## Unit Description: 
During the Imagery unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the active role that imagery plays in storytelling. Imagery will be studied in order to determine usage and appropriateness to the story that it accompanies. 


## Lesson Outcomes:
**I.** Students will culminate their imagery unit with a comic strip.

**II.** Students will demonstrate their ability to utilize all of the skills they have developed thus far to create an imagery heavy story about an important subject.

## Lesson
### I. Overview:
Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given picture. After the introductory activity, students will add the comic strip creator app to their laptops (the app can be found in teacher resources). Each student will be assigned a topic which they will illustrate their opinion on. Upon completion of the comic, students will submit their illustrations for peer review in which two peers must sign off on the comic strips. During peer review, students will be instructed to look for diversity, POV, composition, and responsibility in terms of efficacy and ethics in the comic strips.  After peer review, the comics will be combined into a class comic book, which will be archived for later use. 


### Project:
**Assignment:**  

		

 **1.** Each student will be assigned a topic by the instructor that will be used as the subject of the project. 
 
 **2.** Students will use the comic strip creator app to illustrate their opinion of their assigned topic via a comic strip.
 
 **3.** Upon completion of the comic, students will submit their illustrations for peer review in which two peers must sign off on the comic strips. 
 
 **4.** During peer review, students will be instructed to look for diversity, POV, composition, and responsibility in terms of efficacy and ethics in the comic strips. 
 
 **5.** After peer review, the comics will be combined into a class comic book, which will be archived for later use. 
 

**Project Outcomes:** 
 -   Combining all of the skills honed in the imagery unit into a polished final project which effectively displays the required components/skills, such as diversity, composition, etc.
    
-   Development of peer review skills
    
-   Identifying the major concepts present in multiple works (peer reviewing 2 peerâ€™s comic strips and identifying necessary concepts)
    
-   Demonstrating the ability to give and receive constructive criticism
    

**Final Product(s):**
	
 - Individual Comic Strips 
 - Class Comic-book 




### II. Outcomes:
By the end of the lesson, students will have an in depth understanding of imagery composition styles and rules by both viewing extensive examples of the different types and creating their own examples of the different types. Students will have experience combining and displaying imagery in a way and order that tells a specific story, and deciphering the story a specific combination of images is attempting to convey.


### III. Duration: 
Lesson is expected to last 2 days.

### IV. Preparing to Teach this Lesson:

- [Comic strip creator app](https://chromebooks.pixton.com/schools/login) that students will download and use to create comic strips.


###  Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity
-  **Daily Meme:** The class will begin with an activity that will require students to write a brief story using an image displayed by the instructor.

#### II. Core Lesson Activities
- **Acquiring Key Concepts:** incorporating and utilizing all skills acquired during the imagery unit to produce an imagery heavy story.
- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** peer reviewing comic strips created by classmates, providing constructive criticism, and identifying concepts that were emphasized in class discussion within the work being peer reviewed.

- **Building Proficiencies:** using skills developed thus far to create a unique imagery heavy story and reviewing classmates' work while paying special attention to emphasized concepts such as diversity, POV, composition, and responsibility.

- **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video of a professional artist, filmer, producer, etc. working with comic strips or comics and discussing their work.

- **Assessing Learning:** have students explain how they utilized individual skills gained throughout the unit in the creation of their comic strip. Students can also identify these skills being implemented or the presence of important concepts such as diversity, POV, composition, etc. in their classmates' work.
#### III. Closing Activity: 
Students can view the class comic book and identify what worked well and what worked poorly in terms of design, application of skill sets, narrative, etc.



###  Student Handouts:
If desired, students may be given handouts for feedback during peer review.

###  Implementation Feedback: 
Students will receive feedback from their peers and instructor during peer review. Students can then share what they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
