## Unit Description: 
During the Imagery unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the active role that imagery plays in storytelling. Imagery will be studied in order to determine usage and appropriateness to the story that it accompanies. 


## Lesson Outcomes:
**I.** Students will begin to familiarize themselves with character roles and development via analysis of an episode of a TV show of their choice.

**II.** Developing creative and expressive skills by developing a storyline from individual images.

## Lesson:
 ### I. Overview:
After a brief discussion pertaining to character roles, types, and developments in storytelling, students will find examples of the terms just discussed in clips of TV episodes. Students will propose TV shows to view clips of, and of the proposed shows a few will be selected. While watching clips from the selected episodes, students will dissect the video to identify examples of character roles, types, and development as it was just discussed. The shift from video medium to imagery will take place and students will begin their assignments. The assignment consists of selecting an image as a group and forming a story around said image. The lesson will conclude with groups comparing and contrasting stories and the methods each group took to develop their story.

### II. Project:
**Assignment:**  Single Picture Assignment

		

 **1.** As a group, students will select an image from a resource provided by the instructor, such as the images provided in the [Single Picture Assignment](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9qWAFzy0oO7a19KeVYxWkxoWW8) resource.
 
 **2.** As a group, students will collaborate to form a story around the image they selected. 
 
 **3.** The lesson will conclude with groups comparing and contrasting stories and the methods each group took to develop their story.
 

**Project Outcomes:** 
-   Able to begin identifying roles and character types in literature and film/media.
    
-   Understand the importance of narrative reasoning skills and why they should be developed.
    
-   Narrative reasoning skills are introduced as students justify their decisions and consider the decisions of their peers.
    
-   Emphasis is placed on the importance of writing well.
    
-   Demonstrate ability to produce quality work by working both collaboratively and individually

**Final Product(s):**

- **Building Proficiencies:** using skills from previous discussion and activity to work with a group in developing a unique storyline from a random image.

- **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video interview with a director or writer in which they discuss the concepts focused on in class.

- **Assessing Learning:** have groups explain the methods they used to complete the storyline for their given image. Also allow groups to compare their storyline and steps taken to those of other groups in class. Ask if students are able to identify the concepts of character roles and development in the stories their classmates created.
#### III. Closing Activity:
