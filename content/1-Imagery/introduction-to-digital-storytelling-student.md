**Introduction to Digital Storytelling**

**What You’ll Learn**
In this lesson, you will explore how stories are created in digital media. You’ll take a closer look at your favorite TV shows to understand the roles characters play in storytelling. You will also work in a group to create your own story inspired by a single image, comparing your perspectives and learning how your unique experiences shape your storytelling.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 2 days
* Activities: Icebreaker, TV show analysis, group storytelling activity, discussions, and reflections

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Get to Know Each Other**

   * Start with a fun icebreaker like "Two Truths and a Lie" to warm up and get comfortable sharing ideas with the class.
2. **Dive Into Your Favorite TV Shows**

   * Think of your favorite TV show and share it with the class.
   * Together, we’ll break down a few shows to understand the different types of characters:

     * **Protagonist**: The main character driving the story.
     * **Antagonist**: The character or force that opposes the protagonist.
     * **Instigator**: The character who sparks conflict or change.
   * Discuss how these characters contribute to the story’s development.
3. **Create a Story from an Image**

   * In small groups, choose one of the following images provided by your teacher:

     ![Backlit figure of a young girl on stage, holding a microphone and standing before bright blue stage lights, evoking a performance moment under the spotlight.](/images/uploads/image1.jpg "Image Example 1")

     ![Black and white photo of a small cat standing playfully on a lit bridge at night, facing a person wearing casual pants and sneakers, creating a quiet yet whimsical moment of interaction.](/images/uploads/image2.jpg "Image example 2")

     ![Black and white image of a busy subway station, featuring blurred figures of people in motion with luggage, rows of turnstiles, and illuminated advertisements on the walls, capturing the fast-paced urban environment.](/images/uploads/image3.jpg "Image example 3")

     ![Person sitting on the edge of a dramatic rock ledge, legs dangling, against a backdrop of a clear blue sky and distant green mountains, evoking a sense of freedom and adventure.](/images/uploads/vietnam-7898501_1280.jpg "Image example 4")
   * Work together to write a story inspired by your selected image. Think about:

     * What’s happening in the image?
     * Who are the characters? What roles do they play?
     * What’s the setting, and what emotions does it evoke?
   * Make sure to share your ideas and listen to everyone in your group.
4. **Share and Reflect**

   * Present your story to your group.
   * Compare and contrast how each of you interpreted the image. Discuss:

     * What influenced your perspective? (e.g., personal experiences, feelings, or memories)
     * How did those influences shape your version of the story?
   * Write a short reflection on what you learned about your group members through their stories.

**Why This Matters**
Storytelling is everywhere, from movies to social media posts. Understanding how stories work helps you communicate your ideas and connect with others.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* A group story based on an image
* A reflection on what you learned about your group members
* A deeper understanding of character roles and storytelling in digital media
