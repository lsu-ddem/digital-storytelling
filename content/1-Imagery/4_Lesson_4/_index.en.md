## Unit Description:

During the Imagery unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the active role that imagery plays in storytelling. Imagery will be studied in order to determine usage and appropriateness to the story that it accompanies.

## Lesson Outcomes:

**I.** Students will gain an in-depth understanding of efficacy and the importance of ethics in digital media.

**II.** Students will become familiar with the practice of peer review after the discussion of its importance and effectiveness, though it is a practice that production models often nullify.

## Lesson

### I. Overview:

Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given picture. After the introductory activity, students will upload their images from the prior lesson's closing activity to a class-shared folder without any discussion of the image's owner, subject, or significance. Each student will be assigned one of the uploaded images to use as the subject of a captivating essay. The students will use all of the skills they have developed thus far to write their essay, and must also incorporate a captivating headline and tagline. After completion of the essays, they will be uploaded to the class-shared folder with the same name as their respective image. A brief discussion of peer review will be held, with focus on the purpose and benefits of the practice. Peer review will then begin as two students will read the essay of an unfamiliar image (one that they did not submit and one that they were not assigned), and discuss their view on the ethics of the writing with the author of the essay, making sure to include what they thought about the headline. Students will be reminded to discuss the weights and balances between content, creation, and common respect. After peer review, students will read the essays written by their classmates about their prized possession or person/people pictured in their image.

### II. Outcomes:

By the end of the lesson, students will have gained experience in the practice of peer review and both taking and forming constructive criticism. Students will sharpen their creative and technical skills during the creation of a storyline from an image by using the techniques and strategies of analyzing and deciphering the subject, context, origin, etc. of an image.

### III. Duration:

Lesson is expected to last 2 days.

### IV. Preparing to Teach this Lesson:

#### III. Closing Activity:

After reading the essays, students should begin to express their opinions about the writings; the good, bad, happy, and sad should be expressed. This can lead into the subject matter at hand: ethics, efficacy, and responsibility.

### VI. Student Handouts:

If desired, students may be given handouts for feedback during peer review, or they may be instructed to leave notes in the files in the class-shared folder.

### VII. Implementation Feedback:

Students will receive feedback from their peers and instructor during peer review. Students can then share what they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
