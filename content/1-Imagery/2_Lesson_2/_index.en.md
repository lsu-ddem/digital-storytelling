## Unit Description: 
During the Imagery unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the active role that imagery plays in storytelling. Imagery will be studied in order to determine usage and appropriateness to the story that it accompanies. 


## Lesson Outcomes:
**I.** Students will sharpen their character role and development skills, as well as skills used to develop storylines by creating a unique storyline from an image with unknown history and meaning.

**II.** Sharpening creative, expressive, narrative, reasoning, and critical thinking skills by developing a storyline from individual images.

## Lesson
### I. Overview:
After the introductory activity in which students write a brief story from a given picture, students will begin working on their next projects. The project, "The Images of Heinous Beginnings," involves students working individually to use their narrative reasoning to determine characteristics of an image given by the instructor. The instructor will give a random image to groups of students without its history, origin, or any other information. Students within the groups will individually determine characteristics of the image, such as the time period in which it was taken, location, subject, context, etc. Once the student has determined such characteristics, they will develop a story relevant to the context of the image that incorporates all of the characteristics they have discovered. The story should contain all aspects of an essay except for a conclusion. Students will then present their essays to their group members. Groups will then select one representative to share their story with the class. After all group representatives have spoken, the true origin and characteristics of each image will be revealed. Students will then be given an opportunity to further develop their stories and implement a plot twist now that they are aware of the true characteristics of the image.

### Project:
**Assignment:**  The Images of Heinous Beginnings

		

 **1.** The instructor will give a random image to groups of students without its history, origin, or any other information.
 
 **2.** Students within the groups will individually determine characteristics of the image, such as the time period in which it was taken, location, subject, context, etc. 
 
 **3.** Once the student has determined such characteristics, they will develop a story relevant to the context of the image that incorporates all of the characteristics they have discovered. The story should contain all aspects of an essay except for a conclusion.
 
 **4.** Students will then present their essays to their group members. 
 
 **5.** Groups will then select one representative to share their story with the class.
 
**6.** After all group representatives have spoken, the true origin and characteristics of each image will be revealed.

**7.**  Students will then be given an opportunity to further develop their stories and implement a plot twist now that they are aware of the true characteristics of the image.

**Project Outcomes:** 
-   Demonstrate ability to arrive at conclusions collaboratively, giving consideration to the ideas and justifications of group members
    
-   Gain deductive reasoning skills by drawing conclusions from a single image
    
-   Improve narrative reasoning skills by forming a unique story incorporating specific qualities
    
-   Analyze different technicalities and possibilities in regards to forming a story from the image and selecting the most logical or fitting of options
    
-   Exhibit creativity in creation of a unique story and expression of fixed details, such as assumed time period or scenario.

**Final Product(s):**
	

 - Unique story to accompany given image


### II. Outcomes:
By the end of the lesson, students will have a more in depth understanding of the role imagery plays in storytelling as they have now developed a story relative to characteristics they obtained by analyzing the image.  Students will have a greater understanding of diversity in storytelling and media as they interact with their classmates and understand how they created their interpretations of the different images. 

###  Duration: 
Lesson is expected to last 1-2 days.

### Preparing to Teach this Lesson:

- [Images](http://www.historyinorbit.com/13-children-who-grew-up-to-be-the-most-evil-humans-in-the-world/) to be used in "Images of Heinous Beginnings" Project


## Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity
-  **Daily Meme:** The class will begin with an activity that will require students to write a brief story using an image displayed by the instructor.

#### II. Core Lesson Activities
- **Acquiring Key Concepts:** discussion of narrative reasoning, identifying characteristics and context within a single image.

- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** identifying characteristics and context of a given image via narrative reasoning and analysis.

- **Building Proficiencies:** incorporating the characteristics found in the image into the student's unique storyline, and justifying the reasoning behind the characteristics.

- **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video interview with a director, writer, or historian in which they discuss the concepts focused on in class.

- **Assessing Learning:** have students individually explain the methods they used to analyze their group's given image. Also allow groups to compare their storyline and steps taken to those of their group members and other groups in class. Ask if students are able to agree with the characteristics other students identified following their given reasoning.
#### III. Closing Activity: 
 Students will write a short instance of what they have learned about their classmates' development of their stories, what all went into this process, how it differed from their own process, and what they have learned or gained from the individual stories created.



## Student Handouts:
There are no handouts for this lesson as it is project based.

##  Implementation Feedback: 
Students will receive feedback from their peers and instructor while they are sharing their story with their classmates. Students can then share what they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
