You will explore how ethical practices shape content creation and learn to evaluate and provide constructive feedback through peer review.

* Activities: Writing captivating essays, engaging in peer review, and discussing ethical responsibilities in storytelling

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Get Inspired**

2. **Create and Share**

   * Upload a meaningful image of your own to a shared class folder. Keep your identity as the owner anonymous for this activity.

   * Save your essay in the shared folder, using the same name as the image.
3. **Peer Review**

   * Review at least two essays written by classmates about images that are not your own. Provide constructive feedback, focusing on:

     * Ethical considerations: Is the content respectful and empathetic?
     * Headlines and taglines: Do they balance creativity and responsibility?
   * Engage in a discussion with the essay’s author about their approach and the ethical aspects of their work.
4. **Reflect and Discuss**

     * Responsibility to truth, consumers, and ethical practices
5. **Learn from Professionals**
