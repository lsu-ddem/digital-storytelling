# Lesson

<!--StartFragment-->

**What You’ll Learn** In this lesson, you will use your imagination and reasoning skills to create a story based on a single image of unknown origin. By analyzing artifacts within the image and working collaboratively with your group, you will craft a narrative that aligns with the visual details. You will also learn to adapt your story as new information is revealed, incorporating creative plot twists and logical justifications.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 1-2 days
* Activities: Group storytelling, image analysis, plot development, and presentations

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Get Inspired**

   * Start the class with a fun activity: write a brief story inspired by a meme or image displayed by your teacher.
2. **Introduction to the Project**

   *  You and your group will receive a single image to analyze and build a story around. The image’s true history will not be revealed until later. The following are the links to the images:

3. **Analyze and Brainstorm**

   * Examine the image assigned to your group. Focus on the artifacts and details it contains. Discuss:

     * What time period or location might this image represent?
     * Who could the characters be, and what might their motivations or backstory include?
     * What scenario does the image seem to depict?
   * Use your group’s collective observations to develop a logical and creative storyline. The story should include all the elements of an essay except for a conclusion.
4. **Write Your Story**

   * Collaboratively write your story, balancing creativity with logical reasoning. Include:

     * Key details drawn from the image
     * Reasoned interpretations of the artifacts
     * A cohesive narrative structure
5. **Defend Your Story**

   * Share your story with your group and be prepared to justify your reasoning behind the details and artifacts you incorporated.
   * If the group cannot defend their reasoning, their story may be challenged or revised.
6. **Present to the Class**

   * Each group selects a representative to share their story with the class.
7. **Reveal the Truth**

   * After all presentations, your teacher will reveal the true origins and context of each image.
   * Reflect on how your group’s story compares to the actual history of the image.
8. **Adapt and Add a Plot Twist**

   * Use the new information to write a plot twist or closure to your story. The twist must:

     * Align with the revealed details
     * Fit the established time period and context
     * Add depth or complexity to the characters and scenario

**Why This Matters** This project emphasizes the importance of visual storytelling and critical thinking. It demonstrates how media can shape perceptions and teaches you to approach narratives with both creativity and responsibility.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* A collaborative story based on a single image
* A plot twist or closure inspired by the revealed history of the image
* Improved skills in narrative reasoning, deductive analysis, and teamwork

**Bonus Exploration**

* Reflect on how your perception of the story would change if the image’s characters appeared differently. How might biases or assumptions influence your narrative choices?
