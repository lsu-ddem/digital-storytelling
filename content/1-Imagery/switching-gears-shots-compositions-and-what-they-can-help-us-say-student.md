**What You’ll Learn** In this lesson, you will explore how the composition of an image affects storytelling. You will learn to identify different composition types and understand their impact on the viewer’s emotions and thoughts. By creating your own images and collaborating with your classmates, you’ll see how images can shape and enhance narratives.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 1-2 days
* Activities: Creating a portfolio of image compositions, capturing original images, and making a group storybook

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Get Inspired**

   * Start the class with a fun activity: write a brief story inspired by a meme or image shown by your teacher.
2. **Learn About Composition**

   * Explore examples of composition in photography, paintings, films, and architecture, in this [link](https://nofilmschool.com/2015/09/9-composition-techniques-make-images-eye-catching-biological-level). 
   * Discuss different composition styles, such as rule of thirds, leading lines, symmetry, and framing.
3. **Build a Portfolio**

   * Create a Google Drive folder to act as your composition portfolio.
   * Organize subfolders for each composition style. Begin collecting examples of these styles from online sources or class resources.
   * Share your portfolio progress with your teacher for feedback.
4. **Capture Your Own Images**

   * Practice using the composition types discussed in class. Use your camera (phone, tablet, or other devices) to capture subjects in and around your classroom or campus.
   * Capture at least two strong examples of each composition style. Manage your time effectively.
5. **Organize and Share**

   * Return to your group to organize and label your images in a shared folder.
   * Discuss how the compositions enhance the story or message behind the image.
6. **Create a Storybook**

   * Collaborate with your group to create a storybook using Google Slides. Include all group members’ images, arranged in a logical order to tell a cohesive story.
   * Write a two-sentence description for each image, explaining its role in the story.
   * Label each image with its composition style and add a poetic caption to enhance its impact.
7. **Present and Reflect**

   * Share your storybook with other groups. Compare how different compositions were used and discuss their effects.
   * Reflect on what you learned about storytelling, composition, and collaboration.

**Why This Matters** Understanding image composition helps you create more impactful visuals and narratives. These skills are valuable not only in storytelling but also in other areas like marketing, design, and media production.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* A portfolio of curated examples of image compositions
* Original photos demonstrating mastery of composition styles
* A group-created storybook incorporating all team members’ work
* A deeper understanding of how composition affects storytelling

**Bonus Exploration**

* Research an image that has significantly influenced the world. Analyze its composition and discuss how it contributes to the image’s impact and message.
