## Unit Description: 
During the Imagery unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the active role that imagery plays in storytelling. Imagery will be studied in order to determine usage and appropriateness to the story that it accompanies. 


## Lesson Outcomes:
**I.** Students will gain knowledge of the different types of imagery composition, what effects the different types have on individuals, and how and when to implement the different types of composition. 

**II.** Developing skills to implement creativity and expression while under specific guidelines, such as requiring the use/incorporation of different composition types.

## Lesson
 ### I. Overview:
Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given picture. After the introductory activity, the instructor will begin to show examples of imagery in compositions of photography, film, paintings, architecture, etcetera. Upon reveal of the basic composition styles, students will create a portfolio of great examples of the image composition types.
Within the folder the students will define subfolders of the composition types and begin to import great examples of each of the their respective folders. During the next assignment, students practice replicating the compositions that they have learned about through subjects around the classroom, possibly around the campus (if allowed by the school/instructor). Students should use their cameras to capture subjects using the composition types and rules previously reviewed. Once the students have collected their data, they will regroup and categorize their images with a shared folder; after which they will proceed to create an image storybook using google slides, incorporating all images from the group, that is clear and delivers a message. After completion, groups will share, contrast, and compare their stories with other groups. Afterwards, students must label each of their captured images with the composition style or rule and add a caption to their images describing their image with a poetic flare.

### Project:
**Assignment:**  Students will replicate the compositions that they have learned about through subjects around the classroom, possibly around the campus (if allowed by the school/instructor).

		

 **1.** Students should use their cameras to capture subjects using the composition types and rules previously reviewed. 
 
 **2.** Once the students have collected their data, they will regroup and categorize their images with a shared google drive folder. For each composition type, the students will create the composition type's folder and upload their products of that composition type.
 
 **3.** Groups will then proceed to create an image storybook using google slides, incorporating all images from each member of the group. The storybook must deliver a clear, logical message using the media captured by the group's members.
 
 **4.** After completion of the storybooks, groups will share, contrast, and compare their stories with other groups, offering constructive criticism and feedback.
 
 **5.** After the groups have conversed, students will individually label each of their captured images with the composition style/rule and a caption describing their image with a poetic flare. Ensure that students save their images to their personal portfolios.

**Project Outcomes:** 
 -   Able to identify and decipher between the different image composition types
    
 -   Implementation of each of the image composition types in their own work
    
 -   Producing a collective work (storybook) that fairly and adequately incorporates all members of the groupâ€™s images while maintaining a consistent storyline
    
 -   Efficiently utilizing technology such as cameras, computers, and software to produce a high quality finished product
    
 -   Demonstrating the ability to give and receive constructive criticism
    
 -   Importance of storytelling in media is emphasized and reiterated
    
 -   Students grasp an understanding of the amount of written work that is consumed by media outlets

**Final Product(s):**
	

 - Group Storybook
 - Individual Portfolios/Collections of Exemplary Work
 - Individual Portfolios of Personal Work

 

 ### II. Outcomes:
By the end of the lesson, students will have an in depth understanding of imagery composition styles and rules by both viewing extensive examples of the different types and creating their own examples of the different types. Students will have experience combining and displaying imagery in a way and order that tells a specific story, and deciphering the story a specific combination of images is attempting to convey.


### Duration: 
Lesson is expected to last 1-2 days.

### Preparing to Teach this Lesson:

- [Composition types](https://nofilmschool.com/2015/09/9-composition-techniques-make-images-eye-catching-biological-level) to teach to students.


## Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity
-  **Daily Meme:** The class will begin with an activity that will require students to write a brief story using an image displayed by the instructor.

#### II. Core Lesson Activities
- **Acquiring Key Concepts:** discussion of image composition types, the effects they have, and the creation of images with specific composition type.

- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** creating unique images with applied composition types previously learned in class.

- **Building Proficiencies:** incorporating the characteristics found in the image into the student's unique storyline, and justifying the reasoning behind the characteristics.

- **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video interview with a photographer, filmer, or director discussing their use and take on composition types.

- **Assessing Learning:** have students individually explain one or more composition types in terms of the effects that the images have on individuals and how to achieve different composition types. Allow students to justify the usage and roles of the composition types they used in their images. 
#### III. Closing Activity: 
Students will be assigned the task of capturing an image of something that is important to them. The importance of bringing the images the next day must be stressed as the images are incorporated into the next assignment. The subject and significance of the images must remain confidential until after the next lesson's assignment.



### Student Handouts:
If desired, students may be given out handouts of the [Composition types](https://nofilmschool.com/2015/09/9-composition-techniques-make-images-eye-catching-biological-level) used in this lesson's resources, or some other kind of composition reference sheet.

### Implementation Feedback: 
Students will receive feedback from their peers and instructor while they are sharing their storybooks with their classmates. Students can then share what they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
