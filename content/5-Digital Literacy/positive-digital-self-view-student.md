**Digital Literacy: Understanding and Protecting Your Online Identity**

**What You'll Learn**\
In this lesson, you will explore what it means to be digitally literate. You'll learn how to stay safe online, protect your identity, and communicate responsibly using digital tools. You'll also practice organizing your thoughts using the Cornell note-taking method.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 2 days
* Activities: Icebreaker, class discussion, lecture, Cornell note-taking, group reflection, and a chart activity

**Lesson Activities**

1. **Start with a Conversation**

   * We'll begin with an icebreaker activity (like "Two Truths and a Lie") to get you thinking about your online identity.
   * Then, you’ll see a picture, video, or sound clip. Write a quick story about what might be just outside the frame.
2. **What is Digital Literacy?**

   * You’ll take notes using the [Cornell note-taking method](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-fnzlPK8lcvdFJ3OXlUUWdYUUU?ths=true).
   * We’ll define digital literacy and talk about what a digitally literate person looks like:

     * Knows how to find, create, and share digital info
     * Understands how to judge whether something online is reliable
     * Uses tech in smart, respectful ways
     * Thinks about privacy and how to protect personal info
     * Contributes positively to online communities
3. **Real Talk: What Not to Post**

   * We'll look at funny or inappropriate posts and talk about why they’re good or bad examples.
   * You’ll reflect on how you use different platforms and what kinds of posts fit where. (Think: Saying "hi" on Tinder vs LinkedIn.)
4. **Create Your Own Chart**

   * Make a diagram that shows how you use different platforms (Snapchat, Reddit, Email, etc.) to talk to different people.
   * Below the diagram, list how you can use these tools to make a positive impact online.
5. **Big Questions to Think About**

   * How do other people see me online?
   * What does my "digital self" say about who I am?
   * How can I make sure I’m seen in a positive light?

**Why This Matters**\
Digital literacy is more than just knowing how to use your phone or computer. It’s about being smart, respectful, and thoughtful about what you share and how you interact online. It helps you build your future, connect with others, and protect yourself.

**What You’ll Create**

* A Cornell notes page from the lesson
* A chart showing how you communicate on different platforms
* A reflection on how to stay positive and safe online

**Discussion Points for Class**

* What makes someone digitally literate?
* What are good and bad examples of online behavior?
* How do I want to be seen online, and what can I do to shape that?

**How You’ll Be Graded**\
You’ll show you understand the lesson by:

* Participating in discussions
* Completing your Cornell notes and chart
* Writing a thoughtful reflection about your digital identity and how to protect it

**Wrap-Up**\
Remember: what you share online is part of your story. Let’s make sure it’s one you’re proud to tell.
