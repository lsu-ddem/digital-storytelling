## Lesson:

### I. Overview:

After the daily meme, the students will participate in a lecture and utilize the [Cornell note taking method](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-fnzlPK8lcvdFJ3OXlUUWdYUUU?ths=true) to define and describe digital literacy as well as describe what a digital literate person might personify.

  
  
  

### Lesson Procedure:    

-   After the daily meme the students will be introduced to the idea of digital literacy and develop their own definitions of the terminology based upon lecture, discussion, and note taking.
    
-   The lecture should include and address the following:
    

	-   What is digital literacy?
    

		-   Digital Literacy is the ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills.
    

	-   Remember to keep things fun:
    

		-   Incorporate funny and idiotic examples of proper usage of social media and improper uses of digital platforms to generate media that is unreasonable for the platform
    

		-   A Digitally Literate Person:
    

			-   Possesses the variety of skills – technical and cognitive – required to find, understand, evaluate, create, and communicate digital information in a wide variety of formats;
    
			-   Is able to use diverse technologies appropriately and effectively to retrieve information, interpret results, and judge the quality of that information;
    
			-   Understands the relationship between technology, life-long learning, personal privacy, and stewardship of information;
    
			-   Uses these skills and the appropriate technology to communicate and collaborate with peers, colleagues, family, and on occasion, the general public; and
    
			-   Uses these skills to actively participate in civic society and contribute to a vibrant, informed, and engaged community.
    

		-   After discussion, students will produce:
    

			-   A chart(venn or something similar) to simply describe and configure different formats of acceptable communication to converse with different individuals:
    

				-   peers, colleagues, family, and on occasion, the general public; and
    

			-   Then students shall list below how they can use these avenues or channels how they can actively participate in civic society and contribute to a vibrant, informed, and engaged community.
    

				-   Example: email -> boss||snap->friend etc
    
				-   Example: reddit -> problem solving or issue social vs stack overflow problem solving or issue technical
    

	-   In addition to the lecture about digital literacy the students will develop a practical sense of:
    

		-   All of the content types that they create and responsible ways to publish and share them
    
		-   Reasons why some content might be considered unreasonable for a particular platform and the repercussions that might follow that choice
    
		-   Ways in which a post or share to a certain digital platform might be detrimental or cause issues for the user.
    

			-   During this reflection, think about saying hi on tinder vs saying hi on LinkedIn
    
			-   The implications are different and the underlying meaning can vary
    
	-   Help our students navigate the digital forms of communication knowledgeably
    

	-   Along with these aspects of digital literacy, pose the following questions:
    

		-   Why is it important to create a positive DIGITAL self view?
    
		-   Why would doing this be important?
    
		-   Who would you be doing it for?
    
		-   How do you find about about an individual, that you don’t know?
    
		-   What role does your digital self view have to do with your success in life(education, employment, social, relationships, etc.)?
    
		-   How can you help curate your digital self view?
    

	-   Finally, students will generate:
    

		-   Independent answers to the questions in addition to group answers to the questions
    
		-   A plan of action in order ensure that their digital self view stays true to their self view
    

###  Duration: 
Lesson is expected to last 2 days.

###  Preparing to Teach this Lesson:



##  Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity
-  **Icebreaker:** The class will begin with an icebreaker activity that will stir conversations and or questions(ex:Two lies and a truth).

#### II. Core Lesson Activities
- **Acquiring Key Concepts:** discussion of character roles, types, and development and how to identify these terms in media in any given medium.

- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** identifying the concepts discussed in examples of tv shows and videos.

- **Building Proficiencies:** using skills from previous discussion and activity to work with a group in developing a unique storyline from a random image.

- **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video interview with a director or writer in which they discuss the concepts focused on in class.

- **Assessing Learning:** have groups explain the methods they used to complete the storyline for their given image. Also allow groups to compare their storyline and steps taken to those of other groups in class. Ask if students are able to identify the concepts of character roles and development in the stories their classmates created.
#### III. Closing Activity: 
 Students will write a short instance of what they have learned about their classmates' development of their stories, what all went into this process, how it differed from their own process, and what they have learned or gained from the individual stories created.



##  Student Handouts:
There are no handouts for this lesson as it is project based.

##  Implementation Feedback: 
Students will receive feedback from their peers and instructor while they are sharing their story with their classmates. Students can then share what they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
