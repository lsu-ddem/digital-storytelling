 Lesson Procedure:

 Introduction/Gain Attention

-  Icebreaker: The class will begin with an icebreaker activity that will stir conversations and or questions (ex: Two lies and a truth).

 Project:
-   After the daily meme the students will be introduced to the idea of digital literacy and develop their own definitions of the terminology based upon lecture, discussion, and note taking.
    
-   The lecture should include and address the following:
    

	-   What is digital literacy?
    

		-   Digital Literacy is the ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills.
    

-   Remember to keep things fun:
    

	-   Incorporate funny and idiotic examples of proper usage of social media and improper uses of digital platforms to generate media that is unreasonable for the platform.
    

		-   A Digitally Literate Person:
    

			-   Possesses the variety of skills – technical and cognitive – required to find, understand, evaluate, create, and communicate digital information in a wide variety of formats.
    
			-   Is able to use diverse technologies appropriately and effectively to retrieve information, interpret results, and judge the quality of that information.
    
			-   Understands the relationship between technology, life-long learning, personal privacy, and stewardship of information.
    
			-   Uses these skills and the appropriate technology to communicate and collaborate with peers, colleagues, family, and on occasion, the general public.
    
			-   Uses these skills to actively participate in civic society and contribute to a vibrant, informed, and engaged community.
    

	-   After discussion, students will produce:
    

		-   A chart (Venn diagram or something similar) to simply describe and configure different formats of acceptable communication to converse with different individuals:
    

			-   peers, colleagues, family, and on occasion, the general public
    

		-   Then students shall list below how they can use these avenues or channels to actively participate in civic society and contribute to a vibrant, informed, and engaged community.
    

			-   Example: email -> boss||snap->friend etc
    
			-   Example: reddit -> problem solving or issue social vs stack overflow problem solving or issue technical
    

	-   In addition to the lecture about digital literacy the students will develop a practical sense of:
    

		-   All of the content types that they create and responsible ways to publish and share them.
    
		-   Reasons why some content might be considered unreasonable for a particular platform and the repercussions that might follow that choice.
    
		-   Ways in which a post or share to a certain digital platform might be detrimental or cause issues for the user.
    

		-   During this reflection, think about saying "Hi" on Tinder vs saying "Hi" on LinkedIn.
    
		-   The implications are different and the underlying meaning can vary.
    
	-   Help our students navigate the digital forms of communication knowledgeably.
    

	-   Along with these aspects of digital literacy, pose the following questions:
    

		-   Why is it important to create a positive DIGITAL self view?
    
		-   Why would doing this be important?
    
		-   Who would you be doing it for?
    
		-   How do you find about about an individual, that you don’t know?
    
		-   What role does your digital self view have to do with your success in life(education, employment, social, relationships, etc.)?
    
		-   How can you help curate your digital self view?
    

	-   Finally, students will generate:
    

		-   Independent answers to the questions in addition to group answers to the questions.
    
		-   A plan of action in order ensure that their digital self view stays true to their self view.


 Outcomes:

-   Identify characteristics of a digitally literate individual with a positive digital self view and how to achieve those characteristics.
    
-   Able to navigate digital forms of communication knowledgeably.
    
-   Possess technical and cognitive skills required to find, understand, evaluate, create, and communicate digital information in a wide variety of formats.
    
-   Able to use a number of different technologies to retrieve information, interpret results, and judge quality of obtained information to the best of their ability.
    
-   Clear understanding of the relationship between technology, personal privacy, and stewardship of information.
    
-   Ability to use skills to actively participate in civic society and contribute to a vibrant, informed, and engaged community.
    
-   Knowledge of the many different content types and the responsible ways to publish them.


   Content of Lesson
- Acquiring Key Concepts: discussion of character roles, types, and development and how to identify these terms in media in any given medium.

- Engaging in Experiential Learning: identifying the concepts discussed in examples of tv shows and videos.

- Building Proficiencies: using skills from previous discussion and activity to work with a group in developing a unique storyline from a random image.

- Connecting with STEM Professionals: view a video interview with a director or writer in which they discuss the concepts focused on in class.

- Assessing Learning: have groups explain the methods they used to complete the storyline for their given image. Also allow groups to compare their storyline and steps taken to those of other groups in class. Ask if students are able to identify the concepts of character roles and development in the stories their classmates created.


 Closure and Review
    

-   Reiterate the importance of digital literacy in life, describe the amount of information that is available on us and that we need to be active curators in our own stories.
    
-   Explain the importance of diversity in the storytellers and writers due to experiences and how it shapes our stories.
    

 Higher Level Thinking Skills Noted
    

-   Social engagement in the form of self advocating.
    
-   Developing cross platform skills that will benefit them in the future and lessen the degrees of separation between real world skills and study habits.
    

 Relevance/Rationale:

The art and skill of storytelling that will be practiced in this class will help the students reasoning skills, cognitive constructive capabilities, and develop character. The creation of a narrative requires the student to develop a logical order from a sequence of events. In order for the student to develop a meaningful arrangement of events the student must begin to grow their narrative reasoning skills. These skills can evolve through the consumption and dissection of narrative literature, of a mixed medium. While developing of their narrative reasoning skills the students should/ will become more empathetic to others, wise to deciphering the true purpose of the story, and become comprehensive thinkers of their own circumstances. The students are finally at the age in which they are beginning to construct their own narratives. We, as educators, want them to be exposed to a great diversity of narratives in order mature those narrative reasoning skills. The more developed their narrative reasoning skills are the more they get from a story (deeper perspective). The more advanced their skills, the more likely they are to rationalize why this character chose a particular path, place themselves in the characters shoes, and develop their own character.

  

 Explorations and Extensions:

Besides creating information for yourself what are other ways you can ensure that you are seen in a positive light online?

 Assessment Criteria for Success:

Content knowledge, student knowledge, and appropriate resources are aligned to instructional outcomes. student learning will be assessed throughout the lesson via question responses and correlation to the project.

Students will have successfully met the outcomes when fundamental questions about the importance of digital literacy can be observed through their writing and reflections of their peers work. Also questions about their current disposition are taken into consideration when they see media should begin to arise. Also a fluid and respectful use of time, along with an essay that is fluid, easy to follow, and retains its essentials as an ELA.

  Implementation Feedback: 
Students will receive feedback from their peers and instructor while they are sharing their story with their classmates. Students can then share what they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
