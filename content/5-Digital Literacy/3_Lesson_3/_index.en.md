## Unit Description: 
Discovery and PBL at all levels throughout the unit, students use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information digitally, requiring both cognitive and technical skills.

## Lesson Outcomes:
**I.**  Identify different types of threats present in the cyber world and how to protect oneself and one’s information from different types threats
    
**II.**  Explain methods one can take to increase the protection of personal information and accounts, such as rules for password creation, 2 step verification, etc.
    
  **III.** Ability to define and identify different attack methods and scams, such as phishing, pharming, and spoofing
    
 **IV.**  Thorough understanding of the importance of personally identifiable information and other confidential information, the risks of storing this information without proper protection, and the consequences of having such information leaked



  
## Lesson:
### Overview:
This lesson informs students of identity protection, encryption, hardware, and methods to protect these surfaces from attack. Students will be educated on the concept of identity protection in the digital world. This includes the importance of identity and identity protection as well as methods to protect one’s identity from threats present in the digital world. In order to protect against said threats, students will learn about persistent threats and attacks such as phishing, pharming, and spoofing.
  
  

### Lesson Procedure:

-   After the daily meme the students will be introduced to the concept of identity protection and the procedures to incorporate best practices to ensure the safety of their identity
    
   -   Identity, and importance of keeping it yours and secure:
    

		-   Nowadays your email account is equivalent to a secondary social security account. 
		- It allows you to connect to a variety of different services and stores valuable data. 
		- A very common form of verification is an email verification.
    

		-   Simple steps to ensure that your email is protected include:
    

			1.  Developing a password schema:
    

				-   Develop a strong password that is at least 10 characters and a mixture of characters, numbers, and symbols.
    
				-   Along with that develop a schema for your passwords so you can develop a pattern for your passwords from site to site because, using the same password on multiple sites is dangerous.
    

				-   Schema example: important #(not birthday) **+** word or phrase(incorporate at least one capitalization and symbol into the phrase )**+** unique identifier that changes from site to site(the unique identifier(uid) can be in any format)
				- Ex: 44-3L3ph@nt-g@@gle
    
				-   #-phrase-uid
    

			2.  Make sure to vary the schema’s order from site to site:
    

				-   #-phrase-uid
    
				-   phrase-#-uid
    
				-   uid-#-phrase  
      
    

		-   Simple steps to protect yourself and your digital Identity:
    

			-   Id numbers
    
			-   Passwords
    
			-   2 step verification 
			- Etc.! There are many ways to protect yourself digitally
    

  

	-   Phishing, Pharming, and spoofing:
    

		-   **Phishing** refers to criminal activity that attempts to fraudulently obtain sensitive information
    

			-   Sometimes someone will first send you a benign email (think of this as the bait) to lure you into a conversation and then follow that up with a phishing email. 
			- At other times, the fraudster will just send one phishing email that will direct you to a website requesting you to enter your personal information such as User ID and Password.
    
		-   **Pharming** is another scam where a person installs malicious code on a personal computer. 
			- This code then redirects any clicks you make on a website to another fake Website without your consent or knowledge.
    

		-   To avoid phishing or pharming, follow the basic computer safety guidelines:
    

			-   Pop-Up Warnings
    
			-   Safely Surf the Web
    
			-   Use Anti-Spyware Software(Windows)
    
			-   Be especially careful when entering financial information on a website. Look for the ‘s’ in https in the domain name to know that the website is secure.
    
			-   If the website looks different than when you last visited, be suspicious and don’t click unless you are absolutely certain the site is secure.
    

		-   Now, spoofing comes in many forms, from wifi spoofing(free wifi) to site-spoofing on the receiving of the pharming scams.
		
			- The basic concept of spoofing is creating a "spoofed" resource, such as wifi or a website, that users visit and believe to be legitimate, so they willingly give up login credentials and other information to attackers.
			
			- Spoofed websites will typically look almost exactly identical to the site they are spoofing as the attackers copy the layout of a popular, trusted site to delay the realization of victims realizing the spoof site is not the actual website
			
			- Spoofed sites typically have web addresses that are similar to the legitimate web address, possibly utilizing foreign characters that look identical to english letters, or other methods to trick users into thinking they are visiting the legitimate, secure site.
			
				- Ex: A spoof of facebook might have an address such as "www.facebook.com" that users look over because the difference in the actual url www.facebook.com is not extremely noticeable


###  Duration: 
Lesson is expected to last 2 days.

###  Preparing to Teach this Lesson:



##  Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity
-  **Icebreaker:** The class will begin with an icebreaker activity that will stir conversations and or questions(ex:Two lies and a truth).

#### II. Core Lesson Activities
- **Acquiring Key Concepts:** discussion of character roles, types, and development and how to identify these terms in media in any given medium.

- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** identifying the concepts discussed in examples of tv shows and videos.

- **Building Proficiencies:** using skills from previous discussion and activity to work with a group in developing a unique storyline from a random image.

- **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video interview with a director or writer in which they discuss the concepts focused on in class.

- **Assessing Learning:** have groups explain the methods they used to complete the storyline for their given image. Also allow groups to compare their storyline and steps taken to those of other groups in class. Ask if students are able to identify the concepts of character roles and development in the stories their classmates created.
#### III. Closing Activity: 
 Students will write a short instance of what they have learned about their classmates' development of their stories, what all went into this process, how it differed from their own process, and what they have learned or gained from the individual stories created.



##  Student Handouts:
There are no handouts for this lesson as it is project based.

##  Implementation Feedback: 
Students will receive feedback from their peers and instructor while they are sharing their story with their classmates. Students can then share what they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
