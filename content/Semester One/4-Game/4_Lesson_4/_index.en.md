 Lesson:

 Objective(s):

The students will be producing their game utilizing multiple digital mediums.

 Overview:

This lesson places computational thinking and narrative reasoning in action with the creation of a dynamic story.

 Expected Lesson Duration:

3-4 days

 Preparing to Teach This Lesson:

There are no resources necessary for this lesson. All resources, such as Twinery, have been issued in previous lessons.



 Lesson Procedure:

 Introduction/Gain Attention
    
- Video of the Day: The class will begin with an image that is hopefully game related, and the student and have them write a story about what is just off the boundary of the picture.

 Project
-   After the daily meme the students will begin to work on their resources to complete their games.
    
-   Make the game.
    
-   Publish the story.
    

-   But wait before the students publish their work make sure they proofreadâ€¦
    

	-   Proofreading can be daunting since you need to look at each passage individually in the editor.
    
	-   Instead, choose View Proofing Copy from the story menu.
    
	-   This will create a plain text document with all of the text in the story split into sections based on passages.
    

	-   Review and grading can be: printing this document as-is, save to a PDF in chrome, or copy and paste it into a word processor.
    

	-   Checking for broken links can be done in two ways. First, any passages that do have broken links will be tinted red in the story map. Secondly, choose Story Statistics from the story menu. If the number of broken links is 0, then it is correct as-is.
	
 Outcomes
-   Experience producing a final product using multiple mediums
    
-   Demonstrate appropriate and insightful constructive criticism
    
-   Ability to appropriately receive constructive criticism and give genuine consideration to criticism
    
-   Implement computational thinking skills during the development of the project
    
-   Implement narrative reasoning skills during the development of the project
    
-   Demonstrate increased proficiency in Audacity, Twinery, and other technologies used during the creation/editing of assets    

  Content of Lesson

- Acquiring Key Concepts: implementing and applying skills acquired thus far to create a polished new final product, exercising narrative reasoning skills, experience creating unique resources relevant to the storyline. Implementing documentation skills for stories and video games in pre-production. Correctly using and designing flowcharts. Producing quality custom audio and imagery resources that are relevant and vital to the final product. Combining all phases of the design and development process to produce a polished final product. Formally presenting a final product and interacting with professionals.

- Engaging in Experiential Learning: independently combining all of the skills previously acquired from the class to produce the student's project into a unique final product.

- Building Proficiencies: building confidence and gaining experience with the production of a film or game from beginning to end, utilizing independently created and unique resources.

- Connecting with STEM Professionals: view a video or listen to a professional discussing their process of creating a large project from beginning to end, the importance of each step and phase, etc.

- Assessing Learning: have students share their experience working on a large project independently, asking specifically if they felt confident with the skills they have honed over the semester, whether they had specific insufficient skills that negatively affected their final product, what skills aided the success of their project the most, etc.    

  Closure and Review

-   Reiterate the importance of storytelling in media, describe the amount of written work that is consumed by media outlets and the amount of recycled material that continues to be recirculated due to the lack of new material.
    
-   Explain the importance of diversity in the storytellers and writers due to experiences and how it shapes our stories.
    

 Higher Level Thinking Skills Noted
    

-   Developing a dynamic story
    
-   Adapting stories due to character developments
    
-   Perception due to appearance
    

 Relevance/Rationale:

The art and skill of storytelling that will be practiced in this class will help the students reasoning skills, cognitive constructive capabilities, and develop character. The creation of a narrative requires the student to develop a logical order from a sequence of events. In order for the student to develop a meaningful arrangement of events the student must begin to grow their narrative reasoning skills. These skills can evolve through the consumption and dissection of narrative literature, of a mixed medium. While developing of their narrative reasoning skills the students should/ will become more empathetic to others, wise to deciphering the true purpose of the story, and become comprehensive thinkers of their own circumstances. The students are finally at the age in which they are beginning to construct their own narratives. We, as educators, want them to be exposed to a great diversity of narratives in order mature those narrative reasoning skills. The more developed their narrative reasoning skills are the more they get from a story (deeper perspective). The more advanced their skills, the more likely they are to rationalize why this character chose a particular path, place themselves in the characters shoes, and develop their own character.

 Explorations and Extensions:

Does the dynamic aspect of storytelling take anything away from the message that the author may be trying to deliver?

 Assessment Criteria for Success:

Content knowledge, student knowledge, and appropriate resources are aligned to instructional outcomes. student learning will be assessed throughout the lesson via question responses and correlation to the project.

Students will have successfully met the outcomes when fundamental questions about the importance of storytelling and its role in imagery can be observed through their writing and reflections of their peers work. Also questions about their current disposition are taken into consideration when they see media should begin to arise. Also a fluid and respectful use of time, along with an essay that is fluid, easy to follow, and retains its essentials as an ELA.

 Modifications/Accommodations and Access for All:

A simpler version of Gaming through twinery is already prepared if there are students that need to re-review the information. Also, if students need an alternate assignment due to their personal disposition to the material, alterations will be easily made.

 Implementation Feedback:

Students can receive daily feedback on their project progress from their peers and instructor. Students can then share how they feet about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
