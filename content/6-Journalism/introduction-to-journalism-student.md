# Introduction to Journalism

## What You Will Learn:

* What journalism is and why it's important
* How bias and objectivity influence the news
* Why verifying information is essential
* What makes a story interesting and powerful

## Let’s Start With a Question:

What makes something worth sharing?

## Icebreaker:

We'll begin with a quick game of **"Two Lies and a Truth"** to warm up and think about facts versus fiction.

- - -

## Part 1: What is Journalism?

Journalism is more than just writing. It involves:

* Gathering news
* Checking facts (this is called **verification**)
* Writing and sharing information in a way that helps people make better decisions

**Discussion Prompt:** What do you think it means to find the *"truth about the facts"*?

### Examples:

* Fact: Louisiana has the highest prison population per capita.
* But what are the *reasons* behind this fact? That’s journalism.

- - -

## Part 2: Bias and Objectivity

Everyone has opinions. That means all journalism has some bias. But journalists can still be **fair** by recognizing and managing those biases.

**Let’s Talk About It:**

* Is it okay for journalists to believe in open government?
* Should they include all sides of a story?
* What happens when only official voices are heard?

- - -

## Part 3: Verification and Accuracy

Without checking facts, it isn’t journalism—it’s just opinion.

**Quick Tips:**

* Double-check your sources
* Don’t rely on just one website
* Be clear when something is an opinion vs. a fact

- - -

## Part 4: What Makes a Good Story?

Use these elements to guide your writing:

* Relevant to your audience
* Strong central characters
* Real emotions and tensions
* Details and surprises
* Background information (context)
* Something the reader can learn from or act on

- - -

## Your Project:

Write a one-page article about a topic at your school or in your community. You will:

1. Choose a topic (gaming, school lunch, sports, music, etc.)
2. Interview someone related to that topic (a classmate, teacher, coach, etc.)
3. Use what you've learned about good journalism to tell the story

**Example Questions:**

* How much time do you spend gaming?
* Do you think video games affect your sleep or grades?

Use your notes and the good story checklist to write a draft. We'll peer review in class.

- - -

## What You'll Be Able to Do:

* Explain what journalism is
* Recognize bias and explain how to manage it
* Use facts and verification in your writing
* Create a story that informs and connects with others

- - -

## Wrap-Up:

We’ll share final stories and give each other feedback.

**Think About:**

* What makes your story meaningful?
* How did you make sure your information was accurate?
* How might your story help someone understand something new?

Let’s make the news matter.

- - -

**Extension Question:** Does storytelling in journalism help or hurt the message? Why?

**Feedback Time:** After the project, we’ll reflect on what went well and what could be improved.

Let’s get writing!
