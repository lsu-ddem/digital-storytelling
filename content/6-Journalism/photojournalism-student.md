# Photojournalism - Student Version

## What You'll Learn

In this project, you will explore how powerful images tell real stories. You'll learn the basic skills of photojournalism: taking meaningful photos, writing captions, and following a digital workflow to organize your work like a pro. You'll also learn about ethics in journalism and how your choices as a photographer can impact others.

## How Long It Takes

This lesson will take about 2 days.

## What You’ll Do

### Step 1: Warm-Up

* We’ll start with a fun icebreaker like "Two Truths and a Lie" to get to know each other and think creatively.
* Then, we’ll watch or read some powerful photojournalism pieces (like stories about the Flint Water Crisis or portraits from "Where Love is Illegal").
* In small groups, you will discuss:

  * What story is being told in each photo?
  * How does the caption help?
  * What choices did the photographer make (lighting, timing, angle)?

### Step 2: Explore the Rules

* We’ll talk about the ethics of photojournalism:

  * What’s okay to photograph?
  * How can images hurt or help people?
  * What is your responsibility as a storyteller?

### Step 3: Take Photos

* Choose a subject, area, or issue that matters to you.
* Take **at least 5 photos** that tell a story.
* Edit your photos (crop, adjust color, etc.).
* Write a short title and caption for each one.

### Step 4: Share & Reflect

* You’ll share your photo story with the class.
* We’ll give each other helpful feedback.
* Think about what worked well and what you’d do differently next time.

## What You Will Make

* A mini photojournalism project (5+ photos with captions)
* A digital gallery or presentation of your story

## What You'll Get Better At

* Taking great photos with meaning and purpose
* Writing clear and powerful captions
* Using photography software to manage and edit your images
* Understanding your responsibilities when telling real stories

## Why This Matters

Photojournalism is more than just taking pictures. It’s about showing the truth, making people feel something, and helping the world understand what’s going on. Learning how to do this well gives you a voice and a new way to express your ideas.

## Reflection Questions

* What story did your photos tell?
* How did you decide what moments or details to capture?
* What ethical choices did you have to make?
* How did others react to your photo story?

Be proud of your story. Every photo you take is a chance to make someone think, feel, and see the world differently.
