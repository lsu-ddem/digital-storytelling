#  Lesson

##  Objective(s):

Find and develop a story either within the local community or within the school that allows the student to become immersed and develop a narrative that is true to the subject.

Develop videographic journalism that is reminiscent of the [youth radio](https://www.npr.org/series/4692815/youth-radio) pieces.

Edit the piece in a way that maintains its integrity and ensures the stories continuity.

Review and reflect on the piece and allow the subject/subjects to view and comment on the work.

##  Overview:

This will be a project based on video journalism and the research and development required to produce a video-journalistic piece.

###  Expected Lesson Duration:

1-2 days

###   Lesson Procedure:

####   Introduction/Gain Attention

    

-   The class will begin with an image, video or, sound and the student and have them write a story about what is just off the boundary of the medium.

####  Project

-   After the daily meme the students will be introduced to the video-journalism project.

    

-   As a class the students watch and discuss three short video-journalistic pieces:

    

	-   [https://vimeo.com/269958419](https://vimeo.com/269958419)

    

	-   [https://vimeo.com/268043862](https://vimeo.com/268043862)

    

	-   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FCoVacozII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FCoVacozII) & [https://vimeo.com/267478709](https://vimeo.com/267478709)

    

-   Discuss, describe, and define:

	- the relation of video and photo journalism 

   

	-  the capture process of the data

    

	-  shot types and B-role

    

	-  what separates video and photo journalism

    

	-  what emotions you felt and why you felt them

    

-   What lead to those emotions? Shot type, intimacy with the subject character, color, story and relation to the story?

    

-   Each student will:

   

	-   Find and develop a story either within the local community or within the school community that allows the student to become immersed and develop a narrative that is true to the subject (community is pretty open it can be any level of organization that is related by a: common interest, location, age, family/relation, etc. ).

    

	-   Students will capture data (video, audio, and notes) develop a narrative that is true to the subject.

    

		-   True to the subject means:

    

			-   The lack of romanticism, define please

    

			-   Do not edit the subject to alter their personality or mold them into your ideal subject

    

			-   Ethics, do not exploit your subject

    

			-   The piece should be 3-5 mins long

    

			-   Title

				

			-   Credits

    

			-   Must be shown to the subject/community

			

###  Outcomes:

-   Define videojournalism

    

-   Compare and contrast videojournalism with other types of journalism discussed thus far

    

-   Implement and strengthen computational thinking skills during the development of the project

    

-   Demonstrate increased proficiency in Audacity, Twinery, and other technologies used during the creation/editing of assets

    

-   Implement and strengthen narrative reasoning skills during the development of the project

    

-   Increase presence and awareness in the community, including the people and issues within it

###  Content of Lesson

- **Acquiring Key Concepts**: incorporating and utilizing all skills acquired during the imagery unit to produce an imagery heavy story.

- **Engaging in Experiential Learning**: peer reviewing comic strips created by classmates, providing constructive criticism, and identifying concepts that were emphasized in class discussion within the work being peer reviewed.

- **Building Proficiencies**: using skills developed thus far to create a unique imagery heavy story and reviewing classmates' work while paying special attention to emphasized concepts such as diversity, POV, composition, and responsibility.

- **Connecting with STEM Professionals**: view a video of a professional artist, filmer, producer, etc. working with comic strips or comics and discussing their work.

- **Assessing Learning**: have students explain how they utilized individual skills gained throughout the unit in the creation of their comic strip. Students can also identify these skills being implemented or the presence of important concepts such as diversity, POV, composition, etc. in their classmates' work.

	

###  Closure and Review

-   Reiterate the importance of storytelling in media, describe the amount of written work that is consumed by media outlets and the amount of recycled material that continues to be recirculated due to the lack of new material.

    

-   Explain the importance of diversity in the storytellers and writers due to experiences and how it shapes our stories.

    

##  Higher Level Thinking Skills Noted

    

-   Developing a dynamic story

    

-   Adapting stories due to character developments

    

-   Perception due to appearance

    

##  Relevance/Rationale:

The art and skill of storytelling that will be practiced in this class will help the students reasoning skills, cognitive constructive capabilities, and develop character. The creation of a narrative requires the student to develop a logical order from a sequence of events. In order for the student to develop a meaningful arrangement of events the student must begin to grow their narrative reasoning skills. These skills can evolve through the consumption and dissection of narrative literature, of a mixed medium. While developing of their narrative reasoning skills the students should/ will become more empathetic to others, wise to deciphering the true purpose of the story, and become comprehensive thinkers of their own circumstances. The students are finally at the age in which they are beginning to construct their own narratives. We, as educators, want them to be exposed to a great diversity of narratives in order mature those narrative reasoning skills. The more developed their narrative reasoning skills are the more they get from a story (deeper perspective). The more advanced their skills, the more likely they are to rationalize why this character chose a particular path, place themselves in the characters shoes, and develop their own character.

##  Explorations and Extensions:

Does the dynamic aspect of storytelling take anything away from the message that the author may be trying to deliver?

##  Assessment Criteria for Success:

Content knowledge, student knowledge, and appropriate resources are aligned to instructional outcomes. student learning will be assessed throughout the lesson via question responses and correlation to the project.

Students will have successfully met the outcomes when fundamental questions about the importance of storytelling and its role in imagery can be observed through their writing and reflections of their peers work. Also questions about their current disposition are taken into consideration when they see media should begin to arise. Also a fluid and respectful use of time, along with an essay that is fluid, easy to follow, and retains its essentials as an ELA.

##  Reflections:

To be completed upon the end of lesson.
