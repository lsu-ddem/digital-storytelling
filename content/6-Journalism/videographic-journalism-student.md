**What You Will Do:**

In this project, you will become a video journalist. That means finding a real story in your school or community, planning and filming it, and editing it into a short video that tells the story in a powerful and respectful way.

**Objectives:**

* Find a story in your school or community that matters to someone.
* Record video, take notes, and talk with people to learn more.
* Create a 3–5 minute video story that is true to your subject.
* Share your video with your class and with the people in your story.

**Day 1: Getting Started**

1. **Kick-Off Activity:**

   * Look at an image, video, or sound.
   * Write a quick story about what might be happening just outside the frame.
2. **Watch & Discuss:**

   * As a class, watch these examples of youth video journalism:

**Your Project:**

1. **Pick a story.**

   * It can be about a person, place, group, or issue.
   * It should be something real, something you can film, and something you care about.
2. **Plan and record.**

   * Interview someone involved in the story.
   * Take video clips that show what the story is about.
   * Take notes to help you shape the story.
3. **Edit your video.**

   * Your story should be:

     * 3–5 minutes long
     * Titled and include credits
     * True to your subject (don’t exaggerate or change who they are)
     * Ethically responsible (ask for permission, be respectful)
4. **Get feedback.**

   * Show your finished video to the person or group in your story.
   * Ask what they think and listen to their feedback.
