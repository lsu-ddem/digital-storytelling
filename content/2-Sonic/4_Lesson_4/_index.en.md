The students should interview members of their community concerning their selected subject and record the interview process. The number of interviewees and other guidelines should be set by the instructor. After students have their recorded interviews, they will edit all of their recordings to develop their StoryCorps submission, and submit their story to the national archive.

### V. Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity
-  **Sound of the Day:** The class will begin with an activity that will require students to write a brief story about the content or relation of a sound presented by the instructor.

#### II. Core Lesson Activities
- **Acquiring Key Concepts:** gaining the skills of a "good listener" by covering strategies and practices to be used when listening to audio, conversations, etc. Implementing skills gained to complete an independent project, such as the StoryCorps submission. Becoming familiar with creating and deploying the interview process. Interacting and getting involved within the students' communities. 


- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** creating and developing a submission for StoryCorps's national archive by implementing newly gained skills regarding in depth listening and interview techniques to address a subject relevant within the community.

- **Building Proficiencies:** practicing recently acquired in-depth listening skills by interviewing members of the community, recording interviews, analyzing responses, responding to interviews, and developing the complete story utilizing multiple audio recordings.


- **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video or listen to a few StoryCorps stories, or interviews with the founders or workers at StoryCorps

- **Assessing Learning:** have students justify their selected subject/interview topic and explain why it is pertinent. Ask students what they have gained from their conducted interviews and from the interview process as a whole.

#### III. Closing Activity: 
As this lesson stretches over multiple days, the closing activity should include a discussion of the expectations and requirements of their projects and the rate that the projects should be completed at (ex: tomorrow you should accomplish x, y, and z for your StoryCorps submission). Closing activities after project completion can include showcasing submissions and providing feedback or peer review for each story.


### Student Handouts:
- Students should be directed to the resources provided in the lesson prep section.

### Implementation Feedback:
