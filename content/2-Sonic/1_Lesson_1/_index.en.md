## Unit Description: 
During the Sonic unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the important role that sound plays in storytelling. Sound will be studied in order to determine usage and appropriateness to the story that it accompanies. 


## Lesson Outcomes:
**I.** Introduction to Sound, Music, and the Phenomenon that is sonic language.

**II.** Students will have an in-depth understanding of the importance of sound in storytelling.

## Lesson:
 ### I. Overview:
Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given sound. After the introductory activity, the instructor will explain the importance and use of Cornell Notes handouts (this information can be found in teacher resources). Students will then listen to the radiolab podcast entitled *Psyche and Sound* and take notes on the Cornell Notes handout (found in handout resources). Students should formulate and pose their own questions, in addition to attempting to answer questions such as 
-	What is music?
-	Why does it move us?
-	How does the brain process sound, and why are some people better at processing sound than others?



 ### II. Outcomes:
By the end of the lesson, students will have an in depth understanding of the process of listening and deciphering sounds, and how to use this new knowledge during the creation of new sound.
### Project:
**Assignment:**  Note-taking Assignment

		

 **1.** Students will record notes on Cornell Notes Handouts from a radiolab podcast entitled â€œpsyche and sound".
 

**Project Outcomes:** 
-   Development of notetaking skills
    
-   Explain how listening affects individuals physiologically
    
-   Identify and exercise good listening skills
    
-   Gain an understanding of how sound works scientifically
    
-   Demonstrate an understanding of how sound affects us physiologically
    
-   Contemplate how sound can be manipulated and purposefully used to generate specific desired effects on listeners

**Final Product(s):**
	

 - Notes on Cornell Notes Handouts

### III. Duration: 
Lesson is expected to last 1 day.

### IV. Preparing to Teach this Lesson:
-	Radiolab's [podcast on Musical Language](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91512-musical-language/) that can be presented to the class in podcast form or transcribed into the instructor's lecture.
- [Information on Cornell Notes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-fnzlPK8lcvT1BuSXBaVzlZQTg) handouts that should be used in the lecture prior to students utilizing the handouts.
-	[*Psyche and Sound* Podcast](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-fnzlPK8lcvSmN0OVV3ZW84a28) that students will take notes on.


### Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity
-  **Sound of the Day:** The class will begin with an activity that will require students to write a brief story about the content or relation of a sound presented by the instructor.

#### II. Core Lesson Activities
- **Acquiring Key Concepts:** developing an understanding of the role sound plays in storytelling, questioning the origin of sound and music, and the effect sound and music has on storylines, individuals, and themselves. Additionally, taking notes to the Cornell standard.

- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** practicing new note taking methods via the Cornell standard of note taking, listening to sounds in a new way by paying attention to characteristics emphasized in the *Psyche and Sound* and *Musical Language* podcasts.

- **Building Proficiencies:** establishing a new skillset for listening to sounds, taking more proficient notes. 

- **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video or listen to a podcast of a professional explaining the importance  of the roles sound plays in storytelling.

- **Assessing Learning:** have students provide unique answers to the questions posed during note taking, such as what is music, and why does it move us?

#### III. Closing Activity: 
Discuss the many commonalities present between sound and math with students, asking if students are able to identify any of these commonalities before listing and explaining them to the class.
