<!--StartFragment-->

**What You’ll Learn** In this lesson, you will explore the role of sound in storytelling. You will learn how to listen attentively, take effective notes, and analyze how sound influences emotions and storytelling. This lesson will kick off your journey into understanding sound as a critical element of narrative creation.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 1 day
* Activities: Listening exercises, note-taking, and discussions about sound’s impact on storytelling

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Get Inspired**

   * Begin the class with the **Sound of the Day** activity. Write a brief story inspired by a sound played by your teacher. Reflect on how the sound influences your story’s tone and content.
2. **Listen and Learn**

   * Listen to the Radiolab podcast, *Psyche and Sound*, without any distractions. Electronic devices are not allowed during this activity to help you focus fully on the sound.
   * Use the [Cornell Notes Handout](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Kyf1MC4igp7Lp1TiMAbRyUKmHjOvdiLVtugP91m6Gf0) to take detailed notes during the podcast. Some questions to consider while listening include:

     * What is music?
     * Why does it move us?
     * How does the brain process sound, and why are some people better at it than others?
3. **Discuss and Reflect**

   * After the podcast, discuss your answers to the essential questions with the class.
   * Reflect on how listening affects individuals physiologically and how sound can be purposefully manipulated to create specific effects.
4. **Connect with Professionals**

   * Watch or listen to an interview with a professional (e.g., composer, sound designer, or scientist) discussing the impact of sound on storytelling.

**Why This Matters** Sound is a powerful storytelling tool that affects emotions, sets the tone, and conveys meaning. Understanding its impact helps you create richer and more engaging narratives.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* A detailed set of Cornell Notes summarizing insights from the podcast
* Thoughtful answers to essential questions about sound’s role in storytelling
* A better understanding of how to use sound effectively in your own stories

**Bonus Exploration**

* Analyze the question, “Why does music move us?” Can you replace “move” with a more scientific term? What term would you choose, and why?
