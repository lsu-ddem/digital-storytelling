## Unit Description:

During the Sonic unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the important role that sound plays in storytelling. Sound will be studied in order to determine usage and appropriateness to the story that it accompanies.

## Lesson Outcomes:

**I.** Students will gain knowledge of the tools and best practices for audio creation and recording, and finally implementation into storytelling after the introduction to creating and recording sonic vibrations.

**II.** Students will be versed in software documentation, self documentation, and troubleshooting by using the audio software Audacity.

## Lesson

### I. Overview:

Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given sound. After the introductory activity, students will be given a brief walkthrough of Audacity that explains what it is used for, and how to navigate and use it. Students will then begin experimenting with the software by taking their selected sound file, found from a free source, and manipulating the file's loudness, pitch, quality, timbre, etc. in Audacity. After students have had practice with duplicating, replicating, and combining tracks, they will produce a small soundscape to accompany the image that they took in the last unit (the image with something of significance to them). Soundscapes must meet specific requirements set by the instructor, such as a specified minimum and maximum length, minimum number of original sounds incorporated, maximum number of non-original sounds incorporated, and minimum number of layers.

### II. Outcomes:

By the end of the lesson, students will be familiar with Audacity and its use in creating and manipulating both pre made and original sound files. Students will have experience fitting sound to imagery in regards to storytelling as they produce a soundscape to match the image and storyline they previously produced.

### III. Duration:

Lesson is expected to last 2-3 days.

### IV. Preparing to Teach this Lesson:

* [Audacity software download](http://www.audacityteam.org/) that students will use to produce and manipulate their sounds.
* [Audacity software documentation](http://manual.audacityteam.org/#tutorials) that students and instructors should become familiar with and learn how to navigate.
* [Free sound resource](https://freesound.org/people/newagesoup/sounds/348251/) that students may use to find a sound to experiment with in Audacity. Note that there are other resources online.

### V. Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity

* **Sound of the Day:** The class will begin with an activity that will require students to write a brief story about the content or relation of a sound presented by the instructor.

#### II. Core Lesson Activities

* **Acquiring Key Concepts:** becoming familiar with Audacity software, being able to use Audacity to manipulate sound files, and using both original and pre-made resources to create a soundscape specifically for a previously created image and storyline.

* **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** experimenting with sound manipulation and creation with Audacity software, navigating software documentation during troubleshooting.

* **Building Proficiencies:** establishing a new skillset for creating and editing sounds via Audacity, creating and applying appropriate sounds to a storyline.

* **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video or listen to a podcast of a professional sound artist discussing their work and the process, implementation, and importance of it.

* **Assessing Learning:** have students justify the different components used in their soundscapes in terms of relation to the image and/or storyline they previously created. Students can also demonstrate their understanding of Audacity software and documentation, and that they are capable of using the software and troubleshooting using documentation.

#### III. Closing Activity:

As this lesson stretches over multiple days, the closing activity should include a discussion of the expectations and requirements of their projects and the rate that the projects should be completed at (ex: tomorrow you should accomplish x, y, and z for your soundscape).

### VI. Student Handouts:

* Students should be directed to Audacity's [Software Documentation](http://manual.audacityteam.org/#tutorials) for when students need to troubleshoot while using Audacity, but this does not need to be printed.

### VII. Implementation Feedback:

Students can receive feedback on their soundscape from their peers and instructor. Students can then share what they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
