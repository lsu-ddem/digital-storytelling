## Unit Description: 
During the Sonic unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the important role that sound plays in storytelling. Sound will be studied in order to determine usage and appropriateness to the story that it accompanies. 


## Lesson Outcomes:
**I.** Students will utilize their knowledge of the tools and best practices for audio creation and recording, gain experience developing sonic stories, and integrating sound with their own writing.

**II.** Students will create a multimodal scripted radio show with limited tools and time about a subject matter that is pertinent to the present time.

## Lesson:

	### I. Overview:

Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given sound. After the introductory activity, students will be informed of the subject and guidelines of their next project, in which they will be producing a radio show. Prior to working on the radio shows, students will propose their ideas for the subject of their radio show. After approval, students will write the script and time map for their radio show. Scripts must adhere to guidelines set by the instructor, such as including cues, dialogue, sounds and their descriptions, maximum number of music tracks, limitations on repetitive actions, etc. Students must read and time their scripts prior to recording their radio show, after which they will record the 3-6 minute long show and edit the recording utilizing their newfound sound editing skills with the Audacity software. Each radio show will be broadcasted (played to the class as a whole), after which classmates and the instructor can offer constructive criticism and feedback.

### Project:
**Assignment:**  Scripted Radio Show

 **1.** Students must develop a preposition for their show and have the idea(s) apAs a group, students wi proved by the instructor.
 
 **2.** Student must create and time map the script for their desired show, including cues, dialogue, sounds and descriptions of sounds. 
 
 **3.** Students must time and read their scripts before recording and implementing. 
 
 **4.** Finally, students will edit, record, and publish each show utilizing their Audacity skills.
 
**Project Outcomes:** 
-   Develop and demonstrate time management skills required to complete a quality product within a limited amount of time
    
-   Demonstrate increased proficiency in Audacity during the recording and editing of the radio show
    
-   Exercise and strengthen creative writing and innovation skills during the development of the showâ€™s premise and script
    
-   Ability to organize and execute the recording stage of the project with respect to the timed script, staying within time limits and following the script precisely
    
-   Understanding and demonstration of creating well prepared scripts with cues, dialogue, sounds, description of sounds, times, etc.
    
-   Understanding of the importance and use of well prepared scripts

**Final Product(s):**
	

 - Radio show with a duration of 3-6 minutes

### III. Duration: 
Lesson is expected to last 2-3 days.

### IV. Preparing to Teach this Lesson:
-	[Audacity software download](http://www.audacityteam.org/) that students will continue to use to produce and manipulate their sounds.
- [Audacity software documentation](http://manual.audacityteam.org/#tutorials) that students and instructors should become familiar with and learn how to navigate.


###  Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity
-  **Sound of the Day:** The class will begin with an activity that will require students to write a brief story about the content or relation of a sound presented by the instructor.

#### II. Core Lesson Activities
- **Acquiring Key Concepts:** becoming familiar with the process of proposing and justifying a project concept, creating a sketch and timemap, and gaining more experience with Audacity and implementing the appropriate sounds for a given storyline.

- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** creating and developing a radio show from the initial theme/focus to the polished, finished recording of a 3-6 minute show.

- **Building Proficiencies:** practicing recently acquired Audacity skills by creating and editing sounds using the software, incorporating other mediums, such as writing, into sound for a storyline.

- **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video or listen to a podcast of a professional radio show host describing what all goes into their shows, what they have learned, what is important for the show's success, etc.

- **Assessing Learning:** have students justify their proposal for their radio show, and identify all of the guidelines and requirements set by the instructor within their completed radio show.

#### III. Closing Activity: 
As this lesson stretches over multiple days, the closing activity should include a discussion of the expectations and requirements of their projects and the rate that the projects should be completed at (ex: tomorrow you should accomplish x, y, and z for your soundscape). Closing activities after project completion can include showcasing radio shows and providing feedback or peer review for each show.


### Student Handouts:
- Students should be directed to Audacity's [Software Documentation](http://manual.audacityteam.org/#tutorials) for when students need to troubleshoot while using Audacity, but this does not need to be printed.

### Implementation Feedback: 
Students can receive feedback on their radio show from their peers and instructor. Students can then share what they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
