**What You’ll Learn** In this lesson, you will learn the skills of active listening and conducting interviews. You will explore how storytelling can bring communities together and how your voice can contribute to meaningful conversations. By producing an interview for the StoryCorps national archive, you will engage with your community and apply storytelling techniques in real-world situations.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 1 day
* Activities: Researching StoryCorps, developing interview questions, recording interviews, and reflecting on the process

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Get Inspired**

   * Start with the **Sound of the Day** activity. Write a brief story inspired by a sound played by your teacher. Reflect on how the sound connects to emotions or ideas.
2. **Introduction to StoryCorps**

   * Watch a video about the meaning and purpose of the StoryCorps platform. Learn how it preserves stories and builds connections between people.

   * Research 3 stories on the StoryCorps platform that resonate with you. Write a brief reflection about how and why you connected with those stories.
3. **Choose Your Subject**

   * Select a subject outside of the school, such as a family member, neighbor, or community member.
   * Think about a meaningful topic for the interview. It could be a personal story, a community issue, or a life experience that matters to you and your subject.
4. **Develop Interview Questions**

   * Use the StoryCorps guides:

     * *5 Steps to Recording Your StoryCorps Interview*
     * *10 Conversation Tips*
   * Prepare thoughtful, open-ended questions that will help your subject share their story.
   * Examples include:

     * What life events have shaped who you are?
     * What does community mean to you?
     * What are some of the biggest lessons you’ve learned?
5. **Rehearse and Record**

   * Read through your interview script with a classmate and time it to ensure it flows well.
   * Conduct and record your interview. Focus on:

     * Being an active listener
     * Responding naturally to your subject’s answers
     * Capturing a clear and engaging conversation
6. **Reflect and Submit**

   * After recording, reflect on the process:

     * What did you learn about your subject?
     * How did listening deeply affect your understanding of their story?
   * Submit your interview to the StoryCorps national archive.

**Why This Matters** Storytelling is a powerful way to connect with others and share meaningful perspectives. By listening actively and conducting interviews, you will contribute to a broader community of stories while learning the value of empathy and communication.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**
