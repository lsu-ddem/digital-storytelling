# Lesson

<!--StartFragment-->

**What You’ll Learn** In this lesson, you will learn to manipulate and create sound using Audacity. By experimenting with audio files, you will explore how sound qualities like loudness, pitch, and timbre can enhance storytelling. You will also produce a unique soundscape that complements an image you previously created, combining creativity with technical skills.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 2-3 days
* Activities: Learning [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) basics, manipulating sound files, and creating a soundscape

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Get Inspired**

   * Start the class with the **Sound of the Day** activity. Write a brief story inspired by a sound presented by your teacher. Reflect on how the sound influences your narrative.
2. **Introduction to Audacity**

   * Participate in a quick walkthrough of [Audacity software](https://www.audacityteam.org/). Learn its key features and quirks to prepare for sound manipulation.
3. **Experiment with Sound**

   * Begin with a provided sound file. Experiment by altering its:

     * Loudness
     * Pitch
     * Quality
     * Timbre
   * Practice duplicating, replicating, and combining tracks to understand the basics of sound editing.
4. **Create Your Soundscape**

   * Using Audacity, produce a soundscape that complements the image you created in the previous unit. Your soundscape should:

     * Be 30-60 seconds long
     * Include at least 8 organic (original) sounds
     * Use no more than 4 non-original sounds
     * Have a minimum of four sound layers
5. **Troubleshoot and Document**

   * Use [Audacity’s documentation](https://support.audacityteam.org/) and self-documentation practices to troubleshoot any issues during your project.
6. **Share and Reflect**

   * Present your soundscape to your peers. Explain the creative and technical decisions behind your work, including how the soundscape relates to your image and storyline.
   * Provide and receive feedback to refine your understanding of sound manipulation and storytelling.

**Why This Matters** Combining sound with imagery deepens your ability to tell engaging stories. Learning to use tools like Audacity not only enhances creativity but also equips you with practical technical skills for media creation.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* A polished soundscape that integrates with a previously created image
* A better understanding of sound manipulation techniques using Audacity
* Insights into the relationship between sound and storytelling
