**What You’ll Learn** In this lesson, you will learn how to integrate writing with sound to create a unique and engaging radio show. You will explore audio storytelling techniques, practice using Audacity, and develop skills in writing, timing, and audio production to bring your story to life.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 2-3 days
* Activities: Developing a radio show concept, writing scripts, recording, and editing sound using Audacity

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Get Inspired**

   * Start with the **Sound of the Day** activity. Write a brief story inspired by a sound played by your teacher. Reflect on how the sound shapes your story’s tone and content.
2. **Develop Your Radio Show Concept**

   * Propose a premise for a 3-6 minute radio show. Your premise must be approved by your teacher before you move forward.
   * Think about the main storyline, the intended message, and the sounds that will enhance the narrative.
3. **Write and Map Your Script**

   * Write a detailed script for your radio show. Include:

     * **Cues**: Instructions for sound effects, music, or transitions
     * **Dialogue**: The spoken words or narration
     * **Sounds and Descriptions**: Specific sound effects and how they contribute to the story
     * **Time Mapping**: Plan and time each section of your script to stay within the 3-6 minute limit
   * Rules for the script:

     * Include no more than **2 music tracks**
     * Avoid overly repetitive actions
4. **Rehearse and Record**

   * Practice reading your script to check timing and flow. Make adjustments as needed.
   * Record your radio show using Audacity:

     * Record dialogue and sound effects
     * Layer sounds to create depth and atmosphere
     * Edit the final project to ensure it meets the time limit and follows the script
5. **Refine and Share**

   * Edit your radio show to improve sound quality and timing. Use Audacity’s tools to:

     * Adjust pitch, volume, and balance
     * Combine and layer multiple tracks
     * Add smooth transitions and cues
   * Share your final radio show with the class for feedback.

**Why This Matters** Creating sonic stories allows you to combine writing, creativity, and technical skills. This project will give you experience in producing audio content and teach you how to use sound effectively to tell compelling stories.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* A polished 3-6 minute radio show featuring a well-developed storyline, dialogue, and sound effects
* A time-mapped script with cues, descriptions, and sounds
* A deeper understanding of audio storytelling and sound design

**Bonus Exploration**

* Research the history of radio storytelling and listen to an excerpt from Orson Welles' *War of the Worlds*. Reflect on how sound can be used to create tension, atmosphere, and emotional impact.
