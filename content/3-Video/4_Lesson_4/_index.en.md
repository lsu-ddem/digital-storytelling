## Lesson

### Objective(s):

Students will have experience creating a film incorporating all of the skills and techniques they have learned thus far, while accommodating their film to focus on dialogue, unlike previous films. 

### Overview:
Students will work in groups of two developing a script, storyboard, and film of life goals with emphasis from the instructor that the goal is to create dialogue in the video. Afterwards, students will export them to a digital archive to be stored for 4 years (or until the student's last day of high school). 

### Expected Lesson Duration:
Lesson is expected to last 1-1.5 days.

### Preparing to Teach this Lesson:
Example videos to be shown to students:
- [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGAQrEUaeU)
- [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saCt9SiyZnA)

### Student Handouts:
There are no handouts for this lesson.

### Lesson Procedure:

#### Introduction/Gain Attention
-  **Video of the Day:** The class will begin with the review of the color and sound emotion film project. Each film will be shown and each student is required to write at least one positive and one critical feedback on the projects displayed. These will be placed in the students journals.

#### Project

-   The students will critically review a few videos([vid1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGAQrEUaeU)  [vid2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saCt9SiyZnA)) in which others have pre recorded a video years ago with the intention of responding to ced video in a number of years.
    
-   After the students have watched those videos, observations should be pointed out:
    
	-   Nostalgic memorabilia
    
	-   Space in which the interview takes place.
    
	-   Types of shots taking place
    
	-   Etc.
    

-   Also, the students should take note of the questions and comments that the film directors asked.
    

	-   Things that made it humorous
    
	-   Things that tied the past a present story together
    
	-   Etc.
    

-   The students should begin to write a list of short term and long term goals as it pertains to school, life, and college.
    
	-   Troubles with 9th Grade
    
	-   Relationship Related Issues
    
	-   GPA
    
	-   Possible College Selections
    
	-   Etc.
    

-   The students will work in groups of two in order to define their goals and develop a great storyboard and script.
    

-   Make sure that the students remember to include interjection times and ensure that the students remember that the goal is to create dialogue.
    

-   Unlike other video projects, only a handful of people will see these videos, until four years from now. The students will shoot, edit, and export their stories to a digital archive for grading.

## Outcomes:
    
-   Ability to distinguish between short and long term goals
    
-   Ability to develop plans of action to attain goals
    
-   Creation of a dynamic piece, maintaining fluidity and continuity between shots and throughout the video
    
-   Demonstrate adequate implementation of scripts, storyboards, editing software, etc.
    
-   Demonstrate ability to produce quality work as a result of working collaboratively with a group of peers
    
-   Strengthen and exercise creativity during the development of the dialogue, script, and storyboard

##   Content of Lesson

- **Acquiring Key Concepts:** applying all skills gained thus far to create a time capsule film. Implementing pre-production techniques such as writing scripts and developing storyboards, production techniques such as filming and editing, and post-production techniques such as peer review and archiving. Focusing on conveying meaning through dialogue and sound versus via visual aspects only. 


- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** collaboratively creating a short film with a team member, producing scripts, storyboards, footage, implementing video editing skills, and publishing a completed video/film.

- **Building Proficiencies:** implementing all skills relevant to the production of a film to create an adequate finished product. Adhering to guidelines and stipulations while producing an effective video.


- **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video or listen to a professional discussing their process of creating a similar film.

- **Assessing Learning:** have students explain how they adhered to each stipulation and how the stipulation changed the final product of their video. Students can also explain what skills aided the completion of their video the most, such as their storyboard skills or video editing.

## Closure and Review
    

-   Reiterate the importance of storytelling in media.
    
-   The importance of a compelling, dynamic, and memorable story.
    
-   Digital archive
    

##  Higher Level Thinking Skills Noted
    

-   Why is this teacher making me do this?
    
-   Will I be proud of my accomplishments or will I let myself downâ€¦..
    

## Relevance/Rationale:

The art and skill of storytelling that will be practiced in this class will help the students reasoning skills, cognitive constructive capabilities, and develop character. The creation of a narrative requires the student to develop a logical order from a sequence of events. In order for the student to develop a meaningful arrangement of events the student must begin to grow their narrative reasoning skills. These skills can evolve through the consumption and dissection of narrative literature, of a mixed medium. While developing of their narrative reasoning skills the students should/ will become more empathetic to others, wise to deciphering the true purpose of the story, and become comprehensive thinkers of their own circumstances. The students are finally at the age in which they are beginning to construct their own narratives. We, as educators, want them to be exposed to a great diversity of narratives in order mature those narrative reasoning skills. The more developed their narrative reasoning skills are the more they get from a story (deeper perspective). The more advanced their skills, the more likely they are to rationalize why this character chose a particular path, place themselves in the characters shoes, and develop their own character.

  

## Explorations and Extensions:

If the student wants to go into film, I would suggest creating a piece in four years that ask more questions in another four years.

  

Content knowledge, student knowledge, and appropriate resources are aligned to instructional outcomes. student learning will be assessed throughout the lesson via question responses and correlation to the project.

Students will have successfully met the outcomes when fundamental questions about the importance of storytelling and its role in videography can be observed through their writing and reflections of their peers work. Also questions about their current disposition are taken into consideration when they see media should begin to arise. Also a fluid and respectful use of time, along with an essay that is fluid, easy to follow, and retains its essentials as an ELA.

  

## Modifications/Accommodations and Access for All:

A simpler version of Imagery and storytelling is already prepared if there are students that need to re-review the information. Also, if students need an alternate assignment due to their personal disposition to the material, alterations will be easily made.




## Implementation Feedback: 
Students can receive feedback on their completed films from their peers and instructor. Students can then share how they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
