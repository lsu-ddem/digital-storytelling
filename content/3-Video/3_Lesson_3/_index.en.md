## Unit Description:

During the Video unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the importance of storytelling through the lens of a motion camera.

## Lesson Outcomes:

**I.** Students will gain knowledge of the effects and affects of color and sounds on the human psyche, and ifwhether or not these concepts reign true for all cultures.

**II.** Students will implement all of the skills learned thus far to develop a seven second video that describes a given feeling using only sound and color.

## Lesson

### I. Overview:

Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given video. After the introductory activity, students will review case studies (found in lesson resources) pertaining to the relationship hue has with human emotions, while simultaneously taking notes using the Cornell notes guide. After students read and understand how color affects a person's psyche, the instructor should ask the class questions such as those found in the lesson resources(Case Studies of Color). Questions and answers should be recorded on the students' note guides as well. After completion of the case studies, students will watch the TED talk found in lesson resources, and start a new page of notes on the effects sound has on humans. After students complete note entries, they will listen to the challenge "Emotion in 7 Seconds." Students will form groups and each group will be assigned a different emotion by the instructor. With this emotion, students will write a script, develop a storyboard, and shoot footage for their 7 second film. Once again, a group cannot proceed to shooting footage before their storyboard has been peer reviewed by another group. Groups will only have the remainder of the class period to finish their films. Stipulations for the 7 second film include no text, music, or dialogue within the film. Films must also pertain to a group's given emotion, and any other stipulations implemented by the instructor. During the next class period, students will have 30 minutes to edit their films and export them to the digital class archive. Each 7 second film will then be showcased in a manner that can be decided by the instructor. For example, films can be shown and then the class can guess the emotion the group was assigned, groups can explain why they made specific decisions for their film based on their given emotion, etc. Next class period, all 7 second films can be combined together to create a rainbow of colors and emotions.

### II. Outcomes:

By the end of the lesson, students will have experience running through the development process of a film/video with extremely limited time periods. Students will gain confidence in implementing their skills by having to complete parts of the development process as quickly as possible. Students will have experience creating a meaningful, quality film that meets tight stipulations in less than two class periods, making them more than capable of making films in larger capacities and longer time periods with ease.

### III. Duration:

Lesson is expected to last 1-1.5 days.

### IV. Preparing to Teach this Lesson:

* [Case Studies of Color](http://www.colour-affects.co.uk/) that students will use to do research and take notes.
* [TED Talk : 4 Ways Sound Affects Us](https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_the_4_ways_sound_affects_us)

### V. Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity

* **Video of the Day:** The class will begin with a silent film project. Each film will be shown and each student is required to write at least one positive and one critical feedback on the projects displayed. These will be placed in the students journals.

#### II. Core Lesson Activities

* **Acquiring Key Concepts:** applying all skills gained thus far to create a complete 7 second short film. Implementing pre-production techniques such as writing scripts and developing storyboards, production techniques such as filming and editing, and post-production techniques such as peer review and archiving.

- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** collaboratively creating a short film with a group, producing scripts, storyboards, footage, implementing fresh video editing skills, and publishing a completed video/film.

- **Building Proficiencies:** implementing all skills relevant to the production of a film to create an adequate finished product. Adhering to guidelines and stipulations, all within restrictive deadlines.

* **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video or listen to a professional discussing their use of sound in film or video to have a specific effect on emotions or psyche.

* **Assessing Learning:** have groups explain what individual members worked on, how their story changed over the process of creating the film, what they found most useful or helpful in the process, etc. Groups can also explain their film to instructors and how they accommodated their films to meet the stipulations.

#### III. Closing Activity:

The closing activity can include a discussion of the effects that the imagery and video used within the students' own groups had on them, and justification for why/how they believe their given emotion was portrayed effectively in their films. Viewing of the films will be the next class period's introductory activity, so this should not be the closing activity.

### VI. Student Handouts:

Students will again need to use the [Cornell](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Kyf1MC4igp7Lp1TiMAbRyUKmHjOvdiLVtugP91m6Gf0) notes handout

### VII. Implementation Feedback:

Students can receive feedback on their completed films from their peers and instructor. Students can then share how they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
