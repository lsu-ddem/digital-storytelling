**Reading Lips**

**What You’ll Learn**\
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to take an existing video and rewrite its story. You’ll practice creativity, critical thinking, and audio editing as you give new meaning to a video clip by inventing your own dialogue and narrative.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 2–2.5 days
* Activities: Watching video clips, writing new scripts, editing audio, and sharing your remixed stories

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Get Inspired**

   * Watch the **Video of the Day** presented by your teacher. It might have a historical or political theme.
   * Write a short story based on what you *don’t* see—what could be happening just outside the frame?
2. **Watch and Analyze**

   * Watch short clips from **[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVQSr8NpjrU)**, **[Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v75wCTMZoSY)**, **[Video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RySHDUU2juM)**, and **[Video 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtIPmVN6zdc)**.
   * As you watch, take notes on:

     * The setting and scenery
     * The types of camera shots used
     * The original plot (if any)
     * How sound or silence affects the story
3. **Pick Your Clip**

   * Choose one of the video clips to remix. Your job is to rewrite its story and dialogue using only what you see on screen.
   * You can work solo or in pairs, depending on class size.
4. **Write Your Script**

   * Create a brand-new storyline that fits with the visuals of the video.
   * Your story must relate to a theme assigned by your teacher (for example: *Time*, *Friendship*, or *When your pet giraffe stopped in your neighbor’s yard*).
   * Be creative, funny, or serious—but make sure your new dialogue matches the visuals.
5. **Peer Review**

   * Share your script with a classmate for feedback before recording.
   * Ask questions like: Does the dialogue fit the lip movements? Is the story clear and creative?
6. **Edit and Archive**

   * Record your new audio and edit it into the video using the tools provided.
   * Submit your finished project to the class archive for future viewing.

**Why This Matters**\
This project challenges you to think creatively within limits. You’ll learn how to reshape meaning by changing audio, and you’ll practice writing, editing, and collaboration—all skills used in media, film, and storytelling.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* A remixed video with new, original dialogue
* A creative script that matches visual clues
* A deeper understanding of how sound shapes meaning in video

**Bonus Exploration**

* Which genres (comedy, horror, drama) are easier to remix, and why? How does tone affect your story?
