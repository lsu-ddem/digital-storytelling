## Title: Tools for Creating an Effective 30’s Story

## Unit Description: 
During the Video unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the importance of storytelling through the lens of a motion camera. 

## Lesson

### Objective(s):
By the end of the lesson, students will have experience creating a film incorporating all of the skills and techniques they have learned thus far within a limited time period. Students will gain experience creating a memorable, dynamic, and compelling story with limiting stipulations such as lack of audio and text. This allows the students to find and create deeper meaning through other mediums instead of simply audio, text, or other things the stipulations prevented.

### Overview:
Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given video. After the introductory activity, students will listen to the challenge encompassing the next project, “Tsukanoma no shunkan” (Japanese literal translation is “moment of fleeting” or fleeting moment). In other words, students will form groups and create a silent short film. Students will have one day to write a script, develop a storyboard, and shoot the footage for their silent film. Groups must have their storyboard peer reviewed by another group prior to filming. The films will have stipulations set by the instructor such as being in black and white, not allowing any text, and any additional stipulations put in place by the instructor. For example, other stipulations may include a given subject for the film or an aspect/figure that must be included. During the next class period, students will be given an overview of Apple's video editing software (or another video editing software chosen by the instructor/school). Students will then record and edit their footage using iPads (or other hardware/software) and export them to a digital class archive upon completion. The videos will be presented and reviewed as a class, offering constructive criticism and feedback for each presentation.

### Expected Lesson Duration: 
Lesson is expected to last 2 days.

### Preparing to Teach this Lesson:
There are no resources necessary for this lesson.

### Student Handouts:
Students will again need to use the [storyboard template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-fnzlPK8lcvcTNWUE96Q1BYQ0k/view) from the prior lesson.

### Lesson Procedure:

- ####  Introduction/Gain Attention
	-  **Video of the Day:** The class will begin with an activity that will require students to write a brief story about the content or relation of a video presented by the instructor.

## Outcomes
-   Develop and demonstrate time management skills required to complete a quality product within a limited amount of time
    
-   Demonstrate adequate implementation of scripts, storyboards, editing software, etc.
    
-   Ability to adhere to creative stipulations
    
-   Development of creativity and problem solving skills in adjusting original ideas to adhere to limiting stipulations
    
-   Exercise and strengthen peer reviewing skills
    
-   Demonstrate appropriate and insightful constructive criticism
    
-   Ability to appropriately receive constructive criticism and give genuine consideration to criticism

##   Content of Lesson

- **Acquiring Key Concepts:** applying all skills gained thus far to create a complete 30 second short film. Implementing pre-production techniques such as writing scripts and developing storyboards, production techniques such as filming and editing, and post-production techniques such as peer review and archiving.


- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** collaboratively creating a short film with a group, producing scripts, storyboards, footage, implementing fresh video editing skills, and publishing a completed video/film.

- **Building Proficiencies:** implementing all skills relevant to the production of a film to create an adequate finished product. Adhering to guidelines and stipulations


- **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video or listen to a professional discussing their process of creating a short film, or view exemplary short films and discuss the strategies/methodologies of the film makers.

- **Assessing Learning:** have groups explain what individual members worked on, how their story changed over the process of creating the film, what they found most useful or helpful in the process, etc. Groups can also explain their film to instructors and how they accommodated their films to meet the stipulations.

## Closure and Review
The closing activity can include a showcase of each groups'  30 second films, including a discussion of the film, a showcase of the storyboard, etc.





## Implementation Feedback: 
Students can receive feedback on their completed films from their peers and instructor. Students can then share how they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
