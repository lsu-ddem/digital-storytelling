**What You’ll Learn** In this lesson, you will apply all the skills you have learned so far to create a short silent film. By working collaboratively, you will develop scripts, storyboards, and use editing tools to tell a compelling story visually, while adhering to creative guidelines.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 2 days
* Activities: Writing, storyboarding, filming, editing, and peer reviewing

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Get Inspired**

   * Begin with the **Video of the Day** activity. Watch a short video selected by your teacher and write a brief story inspired by it.
2. **The Challenge: Tsukanoma no Shunkan**

   * Your project focuses on creating a visually compelling **"fleeting moment"** that includes elements such as:

     * Curiosity
     * Details
     * Metaphors
     * Characters
     * Movement
   * These elements do not all need to appear simultaneously, but they are the key to creating memorable moments in film.
3. **Plan Your Film**

   * Form groups and brainstorm ideas for a 30-second silent short film. Your premise must:

     * Be visually engaging
     * Tell a clear story without text or dialogue
   * **Creative Stipulations:**

     * The final film must be in **black and white**.
     * No text or written words can be included in the film.
     * One specific subject or figure (to be announced) must be included.
   * Use the [storyboard template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-fnzlPK8lcvcTNWUE96Q1BYQ0k/view) to map out your shots and scenes.
   * Have another group review your storyboard and provide feedback before you start filming.
4. **Film Your Project**

   * Spend the first day developing your script, creating storyboards, and shooting footage.
   * Focus on composition, lighting, and movement to convey the story visually without relying on sound or text.
   * Place your footage in a shared folder at the end of the day.
5. **Edit Your Film**

   * Use Apple’s video editor (iMovie or a similar tool) to edit your footage on the second day.
   * Key elements to include during editing:

     * Smooth transitions and pacing
     * Enhancing visuals to fit the black-and-white aesthetic
   * Export your final film and submit it to the class’s digital archive for viewing.
6. **Reflect and Share**

   * Watch each group’s final film as a class.
   * Participate in a discussion about what made the moments compelling, dynamic, and memorable. Provide constructive feedback for other groups.
   * Reflect on how time constraints influenced your creative decisions.

**Why This Matters** This project challenges you to apply all the storytelling, composition, and production skills you’ve learned. Working within constraints teaches time management, creativity, and problem-solving—all essential skills in visual storytelling.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* A 30-second black-and-white silent short film
* A complete storyboard and script that aligns with your film
* A reflection on the creative process, challenges faced, and group collaboration

**Bonus Exploration**

* If you had more time, how would you expand or develop your fleeting moment? What additional details, scenes, or ideas would you include?
