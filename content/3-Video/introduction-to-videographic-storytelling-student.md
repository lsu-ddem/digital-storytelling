# Lesson

<!--StartFragment-->

**What You’ll Learn** In this lesson, you will explore how to create and analyze storyboards based on video. By reverse engineering silent films, you will learn the purpose and structure of storyboards and how they serve as a critical tool for visual storytelling.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 2 days
* Activities: Analyzing silent films, learning storyboard techniques, and creating a storyboard based on a short film

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Get Inspired**

   * Begin with the **Video of the Day** activity. Watch a silent video presented by your teacher and write a brief story inspired by what you see. Reflect on how the visuals convey meaning without sound.
2. **Learn About Storyboards**

   * Participate in a discussion or lecture about storyboards. Topics include:

     * What is a storyboard?
     * Why are storyboards important?
     * How do they save time, clarify ideas, and organize projects?
     * How do storyboards align with composition and imagery rules?
   * Work with your teacher and classmates to create a collective example of a storyboard. Watch the short silent film *Affinity - 1912* and break it down into individual shots, mapping the storyline visually.
3. **Analyze Silent Films**

   * Watch two short silent films, *The Lion’s Cage* and *Life*, with the audio muted. Pay attention to:

     * Major scenes and shots
     * Visual storytelling techniques
     * Character actions and key moments
4. **Create Your Storyboard**

   * Choose one of the two silent films (*The Lion’s Cage* or *Life*).
   * Use a storyboard template to recreate the film visually. Your storyboard should:

     * Identify major scenes and shots
     * Include key visual details like character actions, framing, and composition
     * Map the storyline clearly, without relying on dialogue or audio
5. **Reflect and Share**

   * Present your storyboard to the class. Explain:

     * Why you chose specific scenes and shots
     * How your storyboard helps organize and visualize the film’s storyline
   * Discuss the importance of storyboards in professional media production and their role in organizing projects.

**Why This Matters** Storyboards are essential tools for planning visual media projects. Understanding how to map a story visually helps you develop skills in organization, composition, and visual storytelling—key components of professional media creation.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* A detailed storyboard that maps the key scenes and shots of a silent film
* An understanding of how visual storytelling conveys meaning without dialogue or sound
* A deeper appreciation for storyboards as tools for professional media production

**Bonus Exploration**

* Explore how storyboards are used in other fields, such as animation, advertising, and video game design. What are the benefits, and how do they differ from storyboarding in film?
