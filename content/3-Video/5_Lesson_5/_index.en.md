## Unit Description:

During the Video unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the importance of storytelling through the lens of a motion camera.

## Lesson Outcomes:

**I.** Students will further develop narrative reasoning and creative skills by altering the message of an existing story and placing spins on visual scenarios due to alteration of the audio.

## Lesson

### I. Overview:

Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given video. After the introductory activity, students will critically review a few videos pertaining to the lesson. The videos can be found in lesson resources. While watching the videos, students should take note of the scenery and overall plot. After viewing the videos, students will select a video clip. The students will then have to devise a storyline and dialogue that can be facilitated by the video itself. The instructor will set any stipulations for this video. Depending upon the number of students in the class, the instructor may decide to pair students together for this lesson. Students will peer review their finished stories before submission. Finally, all stories will be submitted to the digital class archive.

### II. Outcomes:

By the end of the lesson, students will have experience analyzing and manipulating an already existing video clip, and making a unique and relevant work of writing.

### III. Duration:

Lesson is expected to last 2-2.5 days.
