title:  Introduction to Videographic Storytelling
weight: 1
---

## Unit Description: 
During the Video unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the importance of storytelling through the lens of a motion camera. 

## Lesson:

### Objective(s):
By the end of the lesson, students will have experience creating storyboards and forming storyboards based on video.

### Overview:
Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given video. The intent of this lesson is to expand the students’ concept of videographic media, encompassing the different factors and stages of video development rather than just the final product. After the introductory activity, students will watch two films (provided in lesson resources) with their audio muted. After viewing the films, students will be transitioned from video medium to storyboards during a lecture or class discussion in which they gain an understanding of the use and importance of storyboards, followed by hands on practice with storyboarding. During the lecture or class discussion, the instructor will discuss the purpose and necessity for storyboards, and all of the aspects that pertain to them. After the lecture/class discussion, the class will watch the film Affinity 1912 (in lesson resources). The instructor will complete an example storyboard for the film with the students. The instructor should walk through the shots and concepts while documenting them on the storyboard. Students will then choose one of the two silent films viewed in the beginning of class to recreate independently in storyboard format. 

### Expected Lesson Duration: 
Lesson is expected to last 2 days.

### Preparing to Teach this Lesson:
Videos to be Shown as Silent Films:

-	[1: The Lion's Cage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpjEyBKSfJQ&feature=youtu.be) 

- [2: Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZ6b_I-Djg&feature=youtu.be)

- [3: Affinity - 1912](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjmRBUTapPA)

Storyboard Resources

- [Storyboard Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1krc-FNF7EGUvxVXCDLVW7KvX0cDvZehqQb5pXcirU2w/edit) for students who prefer to learn via writing vs. lecture

### Student Handouts:
Students should be given access to the resources provided in the lesson prep section. Students will need multiple hard copies of the  [Storyboard Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-fnzlPK8lcvcTNWUE96Q1BYQ0k/view)

### Lesson Procedure:
#### Introduction/Gain Attention
-  **Video of the Day:** The class will begin with an activity that will require students to write a brief story about the content or relation of a video presented by the instructor.

#### Project
-  After the completion of students journal entries the students will watch [The Lions Cage](https://youtu.be/mpjEyBKSfJQ) as well as [Life](https://youtu.be/mWZ6b_I-Djg) with the sound muted.
  
-   After watching the films, students will try to recreate the film of their choice (one of the two films) in a storyboard format.
    
-   Transition from a video medium to a storyboard partition
    
-   “What is a storyboard and why do I need one?” lesson in the form of a lecture or a class discussion, including:

	-   Clarity between the team
    
	-   Time (saves time and clarifies a timeline)
    
	-   Script (even if there is no dialogue--- recall the directives in the audio lesson)
    
	-   All professional videos have a storyboard 30s - 3hrs
    
	-   The storyboard comes before the video
    
	-   Concepts and composition (remember in the imagery unit, the students can recall the imagery shared folder with all the composition rules)
    
	-   Continuity of the project and serves as a checklist
    
	-   Subject descriptions and mannerisms
    

-   After the lecture, class discussion, or hybrid of the two, the instructor as well as the students should work on an example together
    
	-  [Share this](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1krc-FNF7EGUvxVXCDLVW7KvX0cDvZehqQb5pXcirU2w) prior to collective example (Some kids work better with a written version)
    
-   Watch [Affinity-1912](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjmRBUTapPA) and ensure that the students have at least one person in their group with the video on their device as well
    
-   Walkthrough the shots and concepts of the video as you document them on your storyboard.
    
-   After each student has received the basics of storyboarding, they must now select one of the two short silent films and begin working.

## Outcomes

-   Understanding of the use and importance of storyboards
    
-   Identify and explain different components of a storyboard
    
-   Implementing storyboards for a pre-existing video
    
-   Ability to identify major shots and scenes that would warrant placement on the video’s storyboard
    
-   Ability to map the storyline of a film visually, without use of the film’s audio providing context and dialogue

##   Content of Lesson

- **Acquiring Key Concepts:** gaining the skills crucial to viewing video/film mediums such as identifying major shots and concepts of a video. Experience with filling storyboards according to the concepts and major shots of a film, gaining knowledge pertaining to the format, purpose, and use of storyboards.


- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** collaboratively creating a storyboard for a film, independently creating a storyboard for a chosen silent film.

- **Building Proficiencies:** identifying important scenes within a film that qualify for placement on a storyboard; proper format and usage of storyboards, identifying major or key concepts in films/video.


- **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video or listen to a professional discussing their use of storyboards and the role they play in their work.

- **Assessing Learning:** have students walk through the storyboard they completed independently and explain their reasoning for the order and/or scenes they included.

## Closure and Review
The closing activity should include a discussion of the importance of storytelling in video and media and how the day's topics, such as storyboards, play an important role in the final product of a video or story.

## Implementation Feedback: 
Students can receive feedback on their completed storyboards from their peers and instructor. Students can then share how they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
