## Unit Description:

During the Video unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the importance of storytelling through the lens of a motion camera.

## Lesson Outcomes:

**I.** Students may think they have a grasp on video, considering their new skills from the imagery and sound unit. If true, this thought will be debunked after this lesson.

**II.** Students will be introduced to video format and its relation to perspective and point of view. Students will also begin working with storyboards.

## Lesson

### I. Overview:

Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given video. The intent of this lesson is to expand the studentsâ€™ concept of videographic media, encompassing the different factors and stages of video development rather than just the final product. After the introductory activity, students will watch two films (provided in lesson resources) with their audio muted. After viewing the films, students will be transitioned from video medium to storyboards during a lecture or class discussion in which they gain an understanding of the use and importance of storyboards, followed by hands on practice with storyboarding. During the lecture or class discussion, the instructor will discuss the purpose and necessity for storyboards, and all of the aspects that pertain to them. After the lecture/class discussion, the class will watch the film Affinity 1912 (in lesson resources). The instructor will complete an example storyboard for the film with the students. The instructor should walk through the shots and concepts while documenting them on the storyboard. Students will then choose one of the two silent films viewed in the beginning of class to recreate independently in storyboard format.

### II. Outcomes:

By the end of the lesson, students will have experience creating storyboards and forming storyboards based on video.

### III. Duration:

Lesson is expected to last 2 days.

### IV. Preparing to Teach this Lesson:

* [Storyboard Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1krc-FNF7EGUvxVXCDLVW7KvX0cDvZehqQb5pXcirU2w/edit) for students who prefer to learn via writing vs. lecture

### V. Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity

* **Video of the Day:** The class will begin with an activity that will require students to write a brief story about the content or relation of a video presented by the instructor.

#### II. Core Lesson Activities

* **Acquiring Key Concepts:** gaining the skills crucial to viewing video/film mediums such as identifying major shots and concepts of a video. Experience with filling storyboards according to the concepts and major shots of a film, gaining knowledge pertaining to the format, purpose, and use of storyboards.

- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** collaboratively creating a storyboard for a film, independently creating a storyboard for a chosen silent film.

- **Building Proficiencies:** identifying important scenes within a film that qualify for placement on a storyboard; proper format and usage of storyboards, identifying major or key concepts in films/video.

* **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video or listen to a professional discussing their use of storyboards and the role they play in their work.

* **Assessing Learning:** have students walk through the storyboard they completed independently and explain their reasoning for the order and/or scenes they included.

#### III. Closing Activity:

The closing activity should include a discussion of the importance of storytelling in video and media and how the day's topics, such as storyboards, play an important role in the final product of a video or story.

### VI. Student Handouts:

Students should be given access to the resources provided in the lesson prep section. Students will need multiple hard copies of the [Storyboard Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-fnzlPK8lcvcTNWUE96Q1BYQ0k/view)

### VII. Implementation Feedback:

Students can receive feedback on their completed storyboards from their peers and instructor. Students can then share how they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
