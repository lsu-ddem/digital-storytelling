# Lesson

## Objective(s):

Students will have experience producing a unique, elaborate, interactive story from the beginning of the design process to the final process of publishing.

## Overview:

Students will produce a game, utilizing multiple digital mediums and techniques learned throughout the course of the school year. 

### Expected Lesson Duration: 

Lesson is expected to last 3-4 days.

#### Interdisciplinary Connection(s) to Common Core

-  <a href = "http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/W/9-10/3/c/" target="_blank">CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.9-10.3.C</a>


### Preparing to Teach this Lesson:

There are no resources necessary for this lesson. All resources, such as Twinery, have been issued in previous lessons.

### Student Handouts:

There are no handouts for this lesson. Students will be using Twinery again, which they should already have downloaded and have experience with.

### Lesson Procedure:

#### Introduction/Gain Attention    

-  Meme of the Day: The class will begin with an image that is game related, and the students will write a story about what is just off the boundary of the picture.

#### Project

- Students will demonstrate an overall understanding of the previous 7 units through the production of a game.

### Outcomes

* Use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills.

    

* Demonstrate development of reasoning skills, cognitive constructive capabilities, and character.

    

* Demonstrate dissection and justification of narrative literature across multiple mediums (audio, visual, text).

    

* Utilize  learned skills to communicate and collaborate with peers, colleagues, family, and/or the general public.

    

* Utilize information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, implementing both cognitive and technical skills.

### Content of Lesson

* **Acquiring Key Concepts**: further developing narrative reasoning, creating unique resources relevant to the storyline. Practice and experience with documentation for stories and video games. Grasping the purpose and correct use of flowcharts. Implementing skills gained from the class to produce custom audio and imagery resources. Combining all phases of the design and development process to produce a polished final product.

* **Engaging in Experiential Learning**: independently combining all of the skills previously acquired from the class to produce produced for the student's story/game into a polished final product.

* **Building Proficiencies**: building confidence and gaining experience with the production of a film or game from beginning to end, utilizing independently created and unique resources.

* **Connecting with STEM Professionals**: view a video or listen to a professional discussing their process of creating a large project from beginning to end, the importance of each step and phase, etc.

* **Assessing Learning**: have students explain why and how they created the resources they did, how they compliment or relate to their storyline and game, what softwares, tools, or techniques they used to create the resources, how the storyboards and flowchart influenced the resources they created, etc.

### Closure and Review 

The closing activity can include a showcase of the final games created by the students, including constructive criticism and positive feedback from classmates and the instructor.

    

## Relevance/Rationale:

The art and skill of storytelling that will be practiced in this class will help the students reasoning skills, cognitive constructive capabilities, and develop character. The creation of a narrative requires the student to develop a logical order from a sequence of events. In order for the student to develop a meaningful arrangement of events the student must begin to grow their narrative reasoning skills. These skills can evolve through the consumption and dissection of narrative literature, of a mixed medium. While developing of their narrative reasoning skills the students should/ will become more empathetic to others, wise to deciphering the true purpose of the story, and become comprehensive thinkers of their own circumstances. The students are finally at the age in which they are beginning to construct their own narratives. We, as educators, want them to be exposed to a great diversity of narratives in order mature those narrative reasoning skills. The more developed their narrative reasoning skills are the more they get from a story (deeper perspective). The more advanced their skills, the more likely they are to rationalize why this character chose a particular path, place themselves in the characters shoes, and develop their own character.

  

## Explorations and Extensions:

Does the dynamic aspect of storytelling take anything away from the message that the author may be trying to deliver?

## Assessment Criteria for Success:

Content knowledge, student knowledge, and appropriate resources are aligned to instructional outcomes. student learning will be assessed throughout the lesson via question responses and correlation to the project.

Students will have successfully met the outcomes when fundamental questions about the importance of storytelling and its role in imagery can be observed through their writing and reflections of their peers work. Also questions about their current disposition are taken into consideration when they see media should begin to arise. Also a fluid and respectful use of time, along with an essay that is fluid, easy to follow, and retains its essentials as an ELA.

## Implementation Feedback: 

Students can receive feedback on their games  from their peers and instructor. Students can then share how they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
