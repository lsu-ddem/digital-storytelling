**Game Development in Action – Part 2**

**What You’ll Learn**\
In this lesson, you'll put everything you’ve learned into action by completing and publishing your interactive Twine game. You’ll use original images and sound, logical branching paths, and solid storytelling techniques to create a polished, playable experience.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 3–4 days
* Activities: Writing, editing, building, and publishing your game

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Warm-Up: Image Story Prompt**

   * Start with a game-related image and write a short story about what might be happening just outside the frame. Be creative and have fun!
2. **Work on Your Game**

   * Open the Twine story you’ve been building.
   * Finish writing all of your story’s branches, choices, and endings.
   * Add your own images and sounds (no copy/paste from the internet — make your own!)
   * Upload your images, sound files, or video clips to your Google Drive.
   * Share them publicly and copy the shareable links.
   * Use the following code to add them into your Twine story:

     * Image:

       ```html
       <img src="LINK" width="500" height="300">
       ```
     * Audio:

       ```html
       <audio src="LINK" autoplay></audio>
       ```
     * Video (optional):

       ```html
       <video src="LINK" width="640" height="480"></video>
       ```
3. **Proof and Test**

   * From the story menu, select **“View Proofing Copy”** to check your writing.
   * This makes a text version that you can read all at once.
   * Check for broken links:

     * Broken passages will appear red in the story map.
     * Or go to the story menu and click **“Story Statistics”**. If broken links = 0, you’re good!
4. **Publish Your Game**

   * From the story menu, choose **“Publish to File”**.
   * This will save your story as an HTML file.
   * Submit the file to your class folder or designated location.

**Why This Matters**\
Finishing and sharing a creative project like this shows off your planning, storytelling, tech, and problem-solving skills. You’ll also practice taking feedback, revising your work, and creating something original and complete.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* A fully functional interactive game made with Twine
* Original sound, images, and writing
* A story with multiple paths and endings

**Reflection Questions**

* What part of your game are you most proud of?
* What was the hardest part to build or write?
* How did feedback from others help improve your work?
* What tools or skills did you use most?

**Need a Simpler Option?**\
If you're having trouble, there’s a simpler version of this assignment you can ask for. Just talk to your teacher.

**Extra Challenge**\
Try creating a printed map of your game’s flowchart — it can help others understand your design and make your story even more impressive!
