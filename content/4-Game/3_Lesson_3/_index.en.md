## Unit Description:

During the Game unit of Digital Storytelling, students will put computational thinking and narrative reasoning to work withduring the creation of a unique, dynamic story.

## Lesson Outcomes:

**I.** Students will continue producing their game utilizing multiple digital mediums.

## Lesson

### I. Overview:

Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given game related image. After the introductory activity, students will resume the design and development process of their games. Students will work on resources to be utilized in their game, such as sounds and images. All resources must be generated independently by the students, and not obtained from an outside source. Students will implement the skills they have honed in terms of sound and image creation to produce the unique assets for their games. The resources will be uploaded to Twinery via HTML embedding to be incorporated into the games.

### Project:
**Assignment:**  Producing unique resources to be used in individual video games

		

 **1.**   After the daily meme the students will begin to work on their resources to complete their games.
    
**2.**  Sounds and images need to be generated by the student, not copied from another source or hotlinked.
    

**3.**  Hotlinking, or using a resource on someone else's server without their permission, is a bad idea. 
- Not only is it freeloading on someone else's bandwidth, but the media could go away at any time, or be replaced by an angry owner with something you weren't expecting!
    

**4.**  After the student has created their images and sounds for their story, they should create a public folder in google drive in order to share those images through twineryâ€“ and put references to them in their story.
    
**5.**   Once you know your image's URL(in Google drive you can just copy the URL), having it display in your story is as simple as entering the correct HTML code to show up:
    

-   <[img](http://december.com/html/4/element/img.html)  src="myPictureOfSomethingDank.goo.com"  width="500"  height="300">
    

-   The width and height part of the code control the size of the image on the page. If you leave them off, then it will display the image in the dimensions that the image is.
    
**6.**   Audio and sound effects are easy to embed to:
   
  - </audio src="myDankSounds.goo.com" autoplay> 
	  - **Note** remove the backslash after the first carat (<) in </audio
    

-   The autoplay attribute causes it to play as soon as the passage it is in is displayed.
    
**7.**   Lastly, if the students need to incorporate video:
    

-   </video src="myDankVideo.goo.com"  width="640"  height="480">   </video>
     - **Note** remove the backslash after the first carat (<) in </video
     
-   I wouldn't tell them about incorporating video because the students loose the art of storytelling when trying to incorporate useless video clips; but some have great ideas of how to incorporate a video, so i would share it with just those students.
 
 

**Project Outcomes:** 
-   Demonstrate adequate knowledge and skills required to produce original assets such as images and sounds
    
-   Implement computational thinking skills during the development of the project
    
-   Strengthen and exercise creativity during the development of unique assets


**Final Product(s):**
	

 - Unique resources to be used in individual video games
 

### II. Outcomes:

By the end of the lesson, students will have experience producing unique, relevant resources relevant to their storylines and games, as well as experience embedding said resources using HTML and Twinery software.

### III. Duration:

Lesson is expected to last 1 day.

### IV. Preparing to Teach this Lesson:

There are no resources necessary for this lesson.

### V. Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity

* **Meme of the Day:** The class will begin with an image that is game related, and the students will write a story about what is just off the boundary of the picture. This will be known as the daily meme. These will be placed in the students journals.

#### II. Core Lesson Activities

* **Acquiring Key Concepts:** further developing narrative reasoning, creating unique resources relevant to the storyline. Practice and experience with documentation for stories and video games. Grasping the purpose and correct use of flowcharts.

- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** creating unique sound and imagery resources designed specifically for storylines written by the students themselves.

- **Building Proficiencies:** creating unique sound and imagery resources using previously attained skills and knowledge.

* **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video or listen to a professional discussing their process of creating resources for their written or animated stories, or to be used in their games.

* **Assessing Learning:** have students explain why they created the resources they did, how they compliment or relate to their storyline and game, what softwares, tools, or techniques they used to create the resources, how the storyboards and flowchart influenced the resources they created, etc.

#### III. Closing Activity:

The closing activity can include peer review of storyboards, flowcharts, and resources, and/or a class viewing of resources created by the students with constructive criticism and positive feedback.

### VI. Student Handouts:

There are no handouts for this lesson. Students will be using Twinery again, which they should already have downloaded and have experience with.

### VII. Implementation Feedback:

Students can receive feedback on their resources from their peers and instructor. Students can then share how they feel about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it so far, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
