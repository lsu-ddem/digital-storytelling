## Unit Description: 
During the Game unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the language of computational thinking and narrative reasoning.


## Lesson Outcomes:
**I.** Students will further develop narrative reasoning and creative skills by exploring possible pathways, timers, and options available for storylines.
**II.**  Students will understand the concept of computational thinking and how it can be applied to various situations and problems
 **III.**  Students will understand the concept of narrative reasoning
 **IV.**  Observe the successful implementation of a dynamic story, how its multiple pathways alter the viewerâ€™s experience, and how dynamic stories adapt to character developments
**V.**   Acquire new technological skills by use of Twinery
    



## Lesson
 ### I. Overview:
Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given game related image. After the introductory activity, students will be introduced to the next project: video games. Students will play the "choose your own ending" game "The Uncle that Works at Nintendo" (found in teacher resources). Students should be instructed to pay attention to and/or take notes on possible pathways, timers, and options that are available, as well as the images, sounds, and videos or motion graphics utilized. After students finish the game, they will be introduced to Twinery, a software that allows for the creation of games similar to the one the students played. After a walk through of Twinery from the instructor, students will begin making their own games with multiple possible endings using the software. Once students finish their stories made with the software, they will export them to an HTML file using Twinery in order to publish the story/game for viewers to read/play.


 
 ### II. Outcomes:
By the end of the lesson, students will have extensive experience using their narrative reasoning and creativity to develop a multi-layered, multi-ending game that presents a unique storyline written by the students themselves. 

### III. Duration: 
Lesson is expected to last 1.5-2 days.

### IV. Preparing to Teach this Lesson:
Game students will play:
- [*The Uncle that Works for Nintendo*](http://jayisgames.com/games/the-uncle/)

Twinery Software:
- [Twinery](https://twinery.org/)




### V. Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity
-  **Meme of the Day:** The class will begin with an image that is game related, and the students will write a story about what is just off the boundary of the picture. This will be known as the daily meme. These will be placed in the students journals.


#### II. Core Lesson Activities
- **Acquiring Key Concepts:** further developing narrative reasoning, creating unique storylines and narratives.


- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** creating unique storylines with multiple endings, plots, etc., and following the unique storylines created by classmates.

- **Building Proficiencies:** strengthening creative narrative skills and narrative reasoning skills, gaining new software skills by use of Twinery.


- **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video or listen to a professional discussing their process of creating a similar game/story, such as the creator(s) of the example game *The Uncle that Works for Nintendo.*

- **Assessing Learning:** have students explain why they chose to follow the route they did in regards to their unique storyline versus possible other ideas they had; additionally, students can explain how they arrived at their multiple endings, which ending they favor, how Twinery allowed their game/story to thrive, etc.

#### III. Closing Activity: 
The closing activity can include students playing each others games after they have published them from Twinery.

### VI. Student Handouts:
There are no handouts for this lesson.

### VII. Implementation Feedback: 
Students can receive feedback on their completed games/stories from their peers and instructor. Students can then share how they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
