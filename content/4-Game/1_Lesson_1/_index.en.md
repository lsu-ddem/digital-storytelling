## Unit Description:

During the Game unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the language of computational thinking and narrative reasoning.

## Lesson Outcomes:

**I.** Students will further develop narrative reasoning and creative skills by exploring possible pathways, timers, and options available for storylines.
**II.** Students will understand the concept of computational thinking and how it can be applied to various situations and problems
**III.** Students will understand the concept of narrative reasoning
**IV.** Observe the successful implementation of a dynamic story, how its multiple pathways alter the viewer’s experience, and how dynamic stories adapt to character developments
**V.** Acquire new technological skills by use of Twinery

## Lesson

### I. Overview:

Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given game related image. After the introductory activity, students will be introduced to the next project: video games. Students will play the "choose your own ending" game "The Uncle that Works at Nintendo" (found in teacher resources). Students should be instructed to pay attention to and/or take notes on possible pathways, timers, and options that are available, as well as the images, sounds, and videos or motion graphics utilized. After students finish the game, they will be introduced to Twinery, a software that allows for the creation of games similar to the one the students played. After a walk through of Twinery from the instructor, students will begin making their own games with multiple possible endings using the software. Once students finish their stories made with the software, they will export them to an HTML file using Twinery in order to publish the story/game for viewers to read/play.

### Project:
**Assignment:**  Creating a video game with Twinery

		

  
    
 **1.** Direct the students to [Twinery](https://twinery.org/). If students have the ability to download twine to their computers I would direct them to do so.
    
 **2.**  Else then, direct the students to use the online version in the top right corner of the screen
    
  **3.** Ensure that the students know that stories in Twine are saved to your web browser itself, not to the twinery.org web site
    
**4.** The best thing to do to avoid problems related to losing work is to regularly archive your work with the -archive- link on the right sidebar of the story list. This saves all of their stories to a file on your computer that they can then restore with the -import- link on the same page.
    
 **5.** Use the green + Story button on the right side of the screen to get started with a new story. 
 - It will pop open a balloon asking what to call it. 
 - Name it whatever – if they need a hand with the naming scheme tell them to name it "the doctor that inspected the orifices of my body only to find out that two had been switched at birth"
    
**6.**  After they give their story a name, they will be taken to its story map. 
 - The story map is a canvas for the story that will expand in size. 
 - Instruct the students to move around it using the scroll bars of the window, or if they are using a touch-based device, just dragging around with their finger.

**7.**   A box pops onto the story map as soon as it opens, called “Untitled Passage.” The story will be made up of individual passages. 

 - Usually, passages are shown one at a time to a reader. 
 - Instruct the students to enter some text in that starting passage. 
 - Do that by either double-clicking it with a mouse, or by tapping it with their finger on a touch-based device and choosing the pencil from the icons that appear…


**8.**  At the top of the editor that appears is a field with the passage's name. The name can be changed any time. 

 - Underneath that is a button to add tags to the passage. For now, they can leave that be.
 - The rest of the editor is for changing the text.
 - Instruct the students to enter a description of what: a terrifying experience it would be if a doctor you that two of your orifices were switched at birth
 - **Ex:** As I sat in my scantily clad hospital gown, in this cold and stale examination room i see my mom sitting in the corner with her favorite red purse with a concerned look on her face.
    

**  Note to the instructor:** I do hope that you realize that you can replace my ridiculous story with your own. To make that easier I have changed the font color of those ridiculous parts.
    

**9.**   After the students have written a paragraph, instruct them to close the passage editor either with the Escape key, or by clicking or tapping the X in the upper-right corner. 

 - There's no need to save work – Twine will automatically do it as changes are made. But please remember the best way to avoid loss of work is to regularly archive your work with the -archive- link on the right sidebar of the story list.
    
**10.**   Next, instruct the students to click or tap the Play button on the right side of the toolbar.
    
**11.**   A new window or tab will appear that shows the story in playable format. Except… it's not very playable at the moment.
    
**12.**   There's nothing for a reader to do but read. Instruct the students to create choices for what to do next.
    
**13.**   Instruct the students to go back to the story map and edit the passage again, and add this text at the bottom:
    
-   Ex:
	-   [[ Ask mom what is wrong ]]
    
	-   [[ Ignore your mom like always, and look at the Garfield picture on the wall ]]
    

**14.**   After the editor is closed, Twine will create two new passages with the names of these choices, and draw connecting lines between them to show that they're linked. These passages have a thinner border than the first one.
    
**15.**  Twine highlights the starting point of the story with a thicker border. The students can change the starting point with the rocket ship icon on the passage's menu.
    

**16.**   The rocket represents the launch point of the story
    

**17.**  The students can rearrange the passages in the story map by dragging them with their mouse or finger.
    

**18.**   Have the students organize things however they like.
    

**19.**  Go ahead and edit these new passages with what you think would happen next. 
- Does the mom just worried for her little sweetums?
-  Does the protagonist's doctor have super bad news for him that the mom already knows about?
    
**20.**   Once the students have added text to the “Ask mom what is wrong,” hit the Play button again. You'll now see clickable links at the end of your story.
    
**21.**   Now the students know enough to create a simple story.
    
**22.**  The students can either keep adding passages to those new ones, or even go back to the beginning and add another option, like [[Break out and run for the door]].
    
**23.**  Once the students are done with their story, click or tap the title of your story in the toolbar. It has a little upward triangle at its end, like “▲”, to indicate that it's a menu. This is the story menu. It contains options that the students won't use as often as they work on your story.
    
-  For example, the students can Rename Story from this menu
    

**24.**   Click on “Publish to File”. This will save the story into an HTML file that works on its own.
 

**Project Outcomes:** 
-   Understand the concept of computational thinking and how it can be applied to various situations and problems
    
-   Implement computational thinking to develop a logical sequence of events for a unique, dynamic story
    
-   Implement narrative reasoning skills to develop multiple pathways for the storyline
    
-   Demonstrate adequate implementation of scripts, storyboards, editing software, etc.

**Final Product(s):**
	

 - Unique video game 
 

### II. Outcomes:

By the end of the lesson, students will have extensive experience using their narrative reasoning and creativity to develop a multi-layered, multi-ending game that presents a unique storyline written by the students themselves.
