**Game Development in Action Pt. 1: Creating Your Own Game Assets**

**What You’ll Learn** In this lesson, you will bring your interactive story to life by creating your own original digital assets. You’ll think like a storyteller, designer, and developer all at once.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 1 day
* Activities: Generating your own images and sounds, embedding them into your game using HTML in Twinery

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Get Inspired**

   * Begin class with a "Video of the Day" or game-themed image.
   * Write a short story about what might be happening just outside the image frame.
2. **Start Building Your Assets**

   * Use any creative tools you’ve learned (drawing apps, sound recorders, etc.) to create your own images and audio.
   * Do NOT copy or hotlink from other websites. All resources should be your own work.
3. **Store and Organize**

   * Upload your assets to a shared Google Drive folder.
   * Make sure your folder is public or shareable so Twine can access the media.
4. **Embed in Twinery**

   * Images:

     ```
     <img src="YOUR_IMAGE_URL" width="500" height="300">
     ```
   * Audio:

     ```
     <audio src="YOUR_AUDIO_URL" autoplay></audio>
     ```
   * Video (advanced, only if needed):

     ```
     <video src="YOUR_VIDEO_URL" width="640" height="480"></video>
     ```
5. **Test Your Work**

   * Use Twinery’s Play function to test how your assets appear and sound.
   * Revise sizing or positioning if needed.
6. **Reflect and Share**

   * Write a short explanation about why you chose the assets you created.
   * How do they support your story? What techniques or tools did you use?

**Why This Matters** Creating your own digital assets not only supports your story but also deepens your understanding of how sound and visuals shape a reader’s experience.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* A folder of original visual and audio resources
* A Twine game enhanced with your assets
* A brief written reflection on your creative choices

**Bonus Exploration**

* Does creating your own assets make the story feel more personal or powerful?

**Tips for Success**

* Archive your Twine story regularly.
* Respect copyright and create everything yourself.
* Ask for feedback from peers and revise!

**Assessment**

* Originality and relevance of assets
* Successful embedding in Twine
* Depth of reflection and connection to story

**Resources**

* [Twine](https://twinery.org/)
* Any tools for drawing, sound recording, or image editing (e.g. Canva, Audacity, phone voice memos)

**Share and Celebrate** At the end of the lesson, we’ll play through a few stories and recognize standout uses of custom assets.
