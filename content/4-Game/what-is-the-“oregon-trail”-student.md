**Interactive Narrative: Twine Game Project**

**What You’ll Learn** In this lesson, you'll explore the creative world of interactive storytelling by playing a branching-path game and building your own. You'll learn to think like both a writer and a game designer, using logic, creativity, and digital tools to create a dynamic story that responds to player choices.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 1.5 to 2 days
* Activities: Playing an interactive game, writing a branching story, learning Twinery software

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Get Inspired**

   * Start the class with a "Video of the Day" or a game-related image. Write a story about what might be happening just off the edge of that image.
2. **Play the Game**

   * Play *The Uncle That Works for Nintendo*: [Play the Game](http://jayisgames.com/games/the-uncle/)
   * As you play, take notes on:

     * The choices available to the player
     * Timers and how they affect the story
     * Story tone and writing style
     * Use of visuals and sounds
3. **Learn Twinery**

   * Visit [Twine Online](https://twinery.org/)
   * Start a new story by clicking the green "+ Story" button
   * Name your story (you can use a silly title or something meaningful!)
   * Use the first passage to write a short creepy or funny scenario (your teacher may suggest a starter prompt)
   * Add choices like: `[[Ask your mom what's wrong]]` or `[[Run for the door]]`
   * Twine will automatically generate new passages linked to these choices
   * Write what happens next in each new passage
4. **Keep Building**

   * Keep adding branches to your story
   * Move the story passages around the canvas to keep things organized
   * Use the "Play" button to test your story as you go
   * Archive your work regularly by clicking the archive link on the story list screen
5. **Publish and Share**

   * Once your story is complete, go to the story menu and select "Publish to File"
   * Save the HTML file and submit it to your class folder or digital archive

**Why This Matters** Creating interactive stories helps you practice decision-making, logic, and creative writing. It also introduces you to digital tools used by professional storytellers and game designers.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* An original interactive story using Twinery
* A branching path game with multiple endings
* A story structure map that shows how your choices lead to different outcomes

**Bonus Exploration**

* Does creating multiple paths change or enhance the meaning of your story? How might a traditional author feel about this?
