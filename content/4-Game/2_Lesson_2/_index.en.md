## Unit Description:

During the Game unit of Digital Storytelling, students will put computational thinking and narrative reasoning to work in the development of games.

## Lesson Outcomes:

**I.** Students will further develop narrative reasoning and creative skills by developing a game with the use of previously gained skills such as script writing and storyboard development.

**II.** Students apply computational thinking skills to develop a logical sequence of events for a unique, dynamic story.

**III.** Students apply narrative reasoning skills to develop multiple pathways for the storyline.

**IV.** Students demonstrate adequate implementation of scripts, storyboards, editing software, etc.

## Lesson

### I. Overview:

Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given game related image. After the introductory activity, students will begin the development process of their new assignment which is the creation of another game. In this lesson, students will work solely on the development stages of the game, which includes writing a script, developing multiple storyboards, and designing a flowchart for their game. A flowchart is necessary because the games will have multiple pathways that a player/protagonist can take, similar to the games made in the previous lesson. The flowchart provides an organized, clear view of all of the possible pathways the student designs. The students will begin with a main storyboard that ends at a decision or path break. At the path break, a new storyboard will be generated, also known as a branch. Branches will also come to a decision or path break, ending the branch's storyboard. For each branch there must be two possible options following; therefore there must be two limbs (storyboards branching off of a branch) per one branch. In total, a minimum of four branches must be created. Therefore there will be a minimum of eight limb storyboards. This lesson requires more planning via storyboards than any lesson prior, but this is solely because most story based games have a 9000+ cell storyboard, and this is a necessary part of the creative and developmental process.

### II. Outcomes:

By the end of the lesson, students will have extensive experience documenting their storyline with multiple endings, preparing the documents for a video game, organizing overall plans with tools such as flowcharts, and sharpened creativity and narrative reasoning skills.

### III. Duration:

Lesson is expected to last 2 days.

### IV. Preparing to Teach this Lesson:

There are no resources necessary for this lesson.

### V. Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity

* **Meme of the Day:** The class will begin with an image that is game related, and the students will write a story about what is just off the boundary of the picture. This will be known as the daily meme. These will be placed in the students journals.

#### II. Core Lesson Activities

* **Acquiring Key Concepts:** further developing narrative reasoning, creating unique storylines and narratives. Practice and experience with documentation for stories and video games. Grasping the purpose and correct use of flowcharts.

- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** creating unique storylines with multiple endings, plots, etc., and following the unique storylines created by classmates.

- **Building Proficiencies:** strengthening creative narrative skills and narrative reasoning skills, continued practice with writing scripts, developing multiple storyboards, developing flow charts, etc.

* **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video or listen to a professional discussing their process of creating a similar game/story, specifically speaking about storyboards and their role in the design and development process.

* **Assessing Learning:** have students explain why they chose to follow the route they did in regards to their unique storyline versus possible other ideas they had; additionally, students can explain how they arrived at their multiple endings, which ending they favor, how the storyboards and flowchart helped or hindered them, etc.

#### III. Closing Activity:

The closing activity can include peer review of storyboards and flowcharts, class readings of storyboards and flowcharts, etc. Since the lesson expands over multiple days, closing activities should include reminders of deadlines and expected progression.

### VI. Student Handouts:

Students will need to use [this flowchart tool](https://www.draw.io/) for the design and development process.

### VII. Implementation Feedback:

Students can receive feedback on their storyboards and flowcharts from their peers and instructor. Students can then share how they feel about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it so far, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
