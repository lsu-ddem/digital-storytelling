**Beginning Storytelling via Games: Storyboard Project**

**What Youâ€™ll Learn** In this lesson, you'll take your first steps into story-based game design by creating a complete storyboard with branching paths. You'll learn how to think through choices and consequences while building a logical and creative story structure.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 2 days
* Activities: Writing scripts, building flowcharts, designing multiple storyboards

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Get Inspired**

   * Start with a "Video of the Day" or game-themed image. Write a short story about what might be just outside the frame.
2. **Plan Your Game Story**

   * Begin thinking about a story-based game idea.
   * Create a script that includes multiple decisions or path breaks for your character.
   * Think about the different paths your story could take and how it might end depending on the choices made.
3. **Build a Flowchart**

   * Draw a flowchart to show how the story branches.
   * Your chart must include:

     * 1 main decision point (branch)
     * At least 4 branches from that point
     * At least 2 outcomes (limbs) per branch = 8 limbs minimum
4. **Storyboard Each Path**

   * For each of your 8 final limbs, create a storyboard panel.
   * Use drawings, captions, and action notes to show what happens.
   * Be sure your storyboards clearly show different outcomes depending on choices.
5. **Script and Storyboard Pairing**

   * Write a short script to match each storyboard.
   * Make sure your script helps explain the logic of the flowchart and the actions in the panels.
6. **Review and Revise**

   * Trade storyboards with a partner.
   * Give feedback on clarity, creativity, and logical flow.
   * Make any needed improvements.

**Why This Matters** Designing a storyboard for a branching story teaches you how writers and game designers build narrative logic and player agency into their stories. It also helps you strengthen your creative and critical thinking skills.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* A flowchart with at least 4 branches and 8 limbs
* A script that explains the paths
* At least 9 total storyboard panels (1 main, 4 branches, 4+ limbs)
* Peer-reviewed and improved versions of your work

**Bonus Exploration**

* Think about your favorite video game. How many possible endings does it have? What kind of choices change the story?
