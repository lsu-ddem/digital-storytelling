**Film Continuity - Student Version**

**What You Will Learn:**

* What film continuity means and why it's important in storytelling.
* The different types of continuity in movies (like movement, action, and look).
* How to spot and fix continuity errors.
* What the "script supervisor" does to help keep movies smooth and realistic.

**Lesson Length:** 2-3 days

**Day 1: Getting Started**

**1. Warm-Up Activity**\
Look at a photo, short video, or listen to a sound. Write a short story about what might be happening just *outside* the frame. This helps train your imagination and attention to detail!

**2. What is Continuity?**\
We will watch a video that shows funny or confusing mistakes (called continuity errors) in popular movies. Then, we will talk about why they matter and how they can distract or confuse the audience.

**3. Do Some Research**\
Pick your favorite movie and look up continuity errors online (try moviemistakes.com). Were you surprised by any?

**4. Group Work**\
Together, we’ll make a list of different types of continuity:

* **Continuity of Information:** Small details that need to stay the same.
* **Continuity of Action:** Movements need to match from one shot to the next.
* **Continuity of Look:** Camera angles and character positions should stay consistent.
* **Continuity of Movement:** Objects and people should move naturally between shots.
* **Continuity of Convention:** Scenes should make logical sense (like traveling in the right direction).

**Day 2-3: Make a Short Film!**

**1. Group Project**\
You and your group will create a short film (1-3 minutes) showing a scene like a dinner party or team meeting. It should have props (cups, notebooks, etc.) that you need to track carefully.

**2. Keep It Real**\
Use your new skills to make sure everything makes sense from one shot to the next. Watch out for things like:

* A glass that’s full in one shot but empty in the next.
* Someone standing up without us seeing them move.
* A shirt sleeve rolled up, then down.

**3. Watch & Reflect**\
After filming, we’ll watch the short films in class. Each group will point out where they worked to keep continuity, and other groups will give helpful feedback.

**Your Goals (Outcomes):**

* Understand what continuity in film means.
* Know who handles continuity on a film crew.
* Be able to name and use different types of continuity.
* Spot when a movie breaks continuity and suggest how to fix it.

**Why This Matters:**\
Good storytelling keeps the audience focused and involved. If there are mistakes in how things look or happen, it can break the illusion. Learning continuity helps you become a better filmmaker, storyteller, and observer.

**Extension Questions:**

* Can storytelling mistakes sometimes *help* a story?
* What happens when a story has a gap or jump in logic?

**How You Will Be Graded:**

* Your participation in class discussions.
* Your work on the short film (planning and editing).
* How well you can explain and use continuity in your project.
* How clearly you explain your thinking when reviewing your own or your classmates' films.

Get ready to spot movie mistakes like a pro—and to keep your own stories clear and connected!
