**Media Adaptation - Student Version**

**What You’ll Learn**\
In this lesson, you’ll explore how stories and ideas change when they're adapted from one format to another — like turning a book into a movie or a show into a comic book. You’ll also create your own media adaptation project, using your storytelling skills to reshape a familiar idea into a brand new format.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 2-3 days
* Activities: Class discussions, media comparison, project planning and creation

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Start With a Prompt**

   * Look at an image, watch a short video, or listen to a sound clip.
   * Write a short story imagining what’s happening just outside the frame.
2. **What is Media Adaptation?**

   * Media adaptation is when a story or content moves from one format to another. For example:

     * A novel becomes a movie (like *The Hunger Games*)
     * A movie becomes a stage play (like *Frozen*)
     * A comic becomes a show (like *Riverdale*)
     * A﻿ videogame becomes a tv series (like *The Last of Us*)
3. **Explore Real Examples**

   * Discuss examples of media adaptations you know. What worked well? What didn’t?
   * Learn about the history of media adaptation, from oral storytelling to ancient plays to modern streaming series.
   * Look at a case study like *Star Trek*, which has been adapted into TV shows, movies, cartoons, comics, and novels.
4. **Plan Your Own Adaptation**

   * Choose a piece of media you love (book, comic, movie, show, etc.).
   * Decide which format you’ll adapt it to: a short film, podcast, story, comic strip, or another creative form.
   * Get your idea approved by your teacher. Be sure to explain:

     * What’s the original format?
     * What’s the new format?
     * How will you stay true to the heart of the original?
5. **Create Your Project**

   * Build your adaptation using the tools and storytelling skills you’ve learned.
   * Think carefully about how different formats change the story — for example, how a film uses visuals and sound, while a book uses language and imagination.
   * Ask classmates for feedback and revise your work.
6. **Present and Reflect**

   * Share your adaptation with the class.
   * Reflect on what changed in the adaptation process. Did anything get lost or improved?
   * Discuss the power and responsibility of re-telling someone else’s story.

**Why This Matters**\
Adapting a story teaches you how to reimagine, reinterpret, and creatively problem-solve. It shows you how ideas can shift across time and culture while staying meaningful. It also helps you think critically about how media influences storytelling.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* A media adaptation of your choice (e.g., video, comic, short story, audio, stage scene)
* A short reflection or presentation explaining your creative choices

**Bonus Exploration**

* Can adapting a story change its original message? Is that good or bad?
* How does adapting a story give it new life in today’s world?

Let your creativity lead the way!
