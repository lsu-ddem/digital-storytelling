**Design in Media - Student Version**

**What You’ll Learn**\
In this lesson, you’ll explore how design choices in media influence how we understand, feel, and react to stories. From costumes to patterns to rhythm, you’ll analyze examples and create your own story using intentional design elements.

**What to Expect**

* Duration: 8 days
* Activities: Media exploration, design analysis, creative project creation

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Start With a Prompt**

   * Look at an image, video, or sound clip.
   * Write a story imagining what is just outside the edge of what you see or hear.
2. **Introduction to Design in Media**

   * Discuss the meaning of design in media: How things are created to make us feel or notice something.
   * Focus on a few key ideas like repetition, patterns, and rhythm.
3. **Learn About Design Elements**

   * **Repetition**: Repeating the same element (color, shape, word, sound, etc.) to build familiarity.
   * **Patterns**: A mix of repeating elements that form a recognizable arrangement.
   * **Rhythm**: The "movement" created by spacing elements.
4. **Types of Rhythm in Design**

   * **Random Rhythm**: No obvious pattern (like snow falling).
   * **Regular Rhythm**: Predictable and evenly spaced (like heartbeats).
   * **Alternating Rhythm**: Switching between two or more elements (like stripes).
   * **Flowing Rhythm**: Elements follow curves or waves.
   * **Progressive Rhythm**: A gradual change in elements as they repeat.
5. **Explore Design in Different Media**

   * Watch short clips, analyze poetry, and look at costume design (example: *Black Panther*).
   * Ask: How does the design make you feel? What does it tell you without words?
6. **Class Design Challenge**

   * As a class, find or create 3 media examples that show rhythm or pattern.
   * Use any format (images, video, poetry, audio). Be creative!
7. **Your Own Design Story Project**

   * Choose a medium (audio, video, story, image, or mix) to tell a short story using design principles.
   * You will use Twinery to build your story but decide your focus: Will it be more visual? More audio-based?
   * Your project must include:

     * Original media (no borrowing someone else’s work)
     * A clear use of repetition, pattern, or rhythm
     * A short explanation of your design choices

**Why This Matters**\
Design is everywhere—in the clothes we wear, the shows we watch, and the apps we use. Learning to see design helps you become a better storyteller and communicator. You’ll learn how even the smallest choices can make a big impact.

**Outcome: What You Will Create**

* A Twinery-based story that uses design concepts
* A design explanation or artist statement

**Bonus Exploration**

* Can breaking design rules (like disrupting a rhythm) make a story more powerful?
* Where do you see rhythm or repetition in real life?

Let your creativity guide your design!
