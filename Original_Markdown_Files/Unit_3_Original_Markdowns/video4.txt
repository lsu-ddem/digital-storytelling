## Unit Description: 
During the Video unit of Digital Storytelling, students will be introduced to the importance of storytelling through the lens of a motion camera. 


## Lesson Outcomes:
**I.** Students will begin to outline their plans, goals, and aspirations.


**II.** Students will distinguish the differences between short term and long term goals, and develop plans of action to obtain their set goals. 

## Lesson
 ### I. Overview:
Students will begin with an introductory activity in which they write a brief story from a given video. After the introductory activity, students will critically review a few videos in which others have pre-recorded a video with the intention of responding to the video in a set number of years. The videos can be found in lesson resources. After viewing the videos, observations such as nostalgic memorabilia, space in which the interview takes place, types of shots, etc. should be pointed out to the class. The students should take note of the questions and comments that are made by the film director. Students will then begin to write a list of short and long term goals as they pertain to school, life, and college. For example, educational goals, relationship goals, gpa, family goals, personal goals, etc. After students list their goals, they will work in groups of two, reviewing their goals and developing a script and storyboard, with emphasis from the instructor that the goal is to create dialogue in the video. After students shoot and edit their stories, they will export them to a digital archive for grading, and will then be stored for 4 years(or until the student's last day of high school) instead of being shared amongst the class. 
 
 ### II. Outcomes:
By the end of the lesson, students will have experience creating a film incorporating all of the skills and techniques they have learned thus far, while accommodating their film to focus on dialogue, unlike previous films. 

### III. Duration: 
Lesson is expected to last 1-1.5 days.

### IV. Preparing to Teach this Lesson:

- [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saCt9SiyZnA)



### V. Learning Activities:

#### I. Introductory Activity
-  **Video of the Day:** The class will begin with the review of the color and sound emotion film project. Each film will be shown and each student is required to write at least one positive and one critical feedback on the projects displayed. These will be placed in the students journals.


#### II. Core Lesson Activities
- **Acquiring Key Concepts:** applying all skills gained thus far to create a time capsule film. Implementing pre-production techniques such as writing scripts and developing storyboards, production techniques such as filming and editing, and post-production techniques such as peer review and archiving. Focusing on conveying meaning through dialogue and sound versus via visual aspects only. 


- **Engaging in Experiential Learning:** collaboratively creating a short film with a team member, producing scripts, storyboards, footage, implementing video editing skills, and publishing a completed video/film.

- **Building Proficiencies:** implementing all skills relevant to the production of a film to create an adequate finished product. Adhering to guidelines and stipulations while producing an effective video.


- **Connecting with STEM Professionals:** view a video or listen to a professional discussing their process of creating a similar film.

- **Assessing Learning:** have students explain how they adhered to each stipulation and how the stipulation changed the final product of their video. Students can also explain what skills aided the completion of their video the most, such as their storyboard skills or video editing.

#### III. Closing Activity: 
The closing activity can include a class discussion of what story was told in these videos and how the videos are examples of the importance of storytelling in media. 

### VI. Student Handouts:
There are no handouts for this lesson.

### VII. Implementation Feedback: 
Students can receive feedback on their completed films from their peers and instructor. Students can then share how they felt about the project with their instructor; as well as what they gained from it, how it could have better benefited them, etc.
